    "content": "Google is working on a multi-year project to fully migrate Chrome OS to Android as part of an effort to better compete with Apple's iPad, according to a new report from Android Authority citing an internal source at the company.\nThe initiative would apparently see future Chromebook devices shipping with a desktop-optimized version of Android rather than Chrome OS, which would be a major shift in Google's operating system strategy. Google announced in June 2024 that Chrome OS would begin incorporating portions of Android's technical foundation, but the reported plans go much further toward a complete merger of the two platforms.\nGoogle is already laying groundwork for the transition by developing a new version of Chrome for Android with extension support and a Terminal application for running Linux apps. The company is also working on improved keyboard, mouse, and external display support for Android, along with features like multiple desktop spaces.\nThe consolidation aims to create a more unified platform that can better challenge Apple's dominance in the high-end tablet market while allowing Google to more efficiently manage its development resources. Currently, neither Chrome OS nor Android has successfully competed with iPad, despite the multitasking shortcomings of iPadOS.\nThe report notes that the strategy could also benefit the Android ecosystem by expanding its user base and making it more attractive to developers. Meanwhile, a separate report from Android Headlines suggests Google is developing a high-end Pixel-branded laptop, which could potentially showcase the new desktop-oriented Android platform.\nGoogle has not officially confirmed plans to phase out Chrome OS in favor of Android, and the company declined to comment on the report when contacted by Android Authority.\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\nFind all of the season's best Apple and Apple-related gifts in our 2024 Gift Guide.\nApple Intelligence is what Apple is calling its artificial intelligence feature set, previewed at WWDC in June 2024.

    "content": "Pubblicit\ufffd\n29 Ottobre 2024 12\nNelle scorse ore è uscita una nuova versione di Raspberry Pi OS, il sistema operativo su cui si basano le popolarissime tinkerer board. La novità principale sarà particolarmente interessante soprattutto per i modelli più vecchiotti: tutti passeranno a un compositor di tipo Wayland invece dell’ormai vetusto X. La Raspberry Foundation ha trovato un compositor tutto nuovo, chiamato labwc, che riesce a girare bene anche su modelli più vecchi, a differenza del precedente wayfire, introdotto nel 2023 e reso disponibile solo su Raspberry Pi 4 e 5, appunto per problemi prestazionali.\nRaspberry Pi OS è basato su Linux, il sistema operativo open-source inventato da Linus Torvalds. Linux ha usato per anni X come “window manager”, sostanzialmente la parte di software di disegnare sul monitor il desktop, gestire le finestre delle applicazioni, mostrare il puntatore del mouse - insomma, un’interfaccia grafica. Tecnicamente X è ancora più vecchio di Linux: è nato con Unix. Le decadi ormai si fanno sentire, e quindi negli ultimi anni la maggior parte delle distribuzioni è passata a una tecnologia più nuova e moderna, chiamata appunto Wayland.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tHardware\n\t\t25 Ott\n\t\nLa Raspberry Foundation spiega che una volta scaricato e installato il nuovo OS sui RasPi 4 e 5 il sistema chiederà all’utente se continuare a usare Wayfire o se passare al nuovo Labwc (è anche possibile posticipare la scelta, se si preferisce). Tutti gli utenti sono invitati ad adottare il nuovo compositor, perché anche sulle board più recenti il miglioramento prestazionale è tangibile. La procedura per ottenere il nuovo OS è relativamente semplice, e richiede di inserire questi comandi sul terminale:\nIl popup di scelta del compositor potrebbe non essere visualizzato subito perché alcuni utenti hanno riportato un bug, ma dovrebbe tornare in tempi relativamente brevi.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t13 Novembre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t08 Novembre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t04 Novembre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t25 Ottobre 2024\n\t\ngi\ufffd messo con wireguard su una vps che uso all'occorrenza.\nla nuova tastiera virtuale e' fantastica, perfettamente integrata col sistema, esce in automatico quando c'e' una input, e in ogni caso c'e' un pulsante sempre a portata di mano per aprirla o chiuderla, finalmenteeee.grandissimi.per quanto riguarda wayland, lo usavo gia prima sul raspberry, e da anni su tutti e 3 i miei pc.\nX lo si usa anche per X.Org, infatti X come nome fa solo confusione\nAllucinazioni dell'IA!\nL'aveva trovato prima Riccardo!\nAnche tu fai imprecisioni...

Here’s how it works.\n\n\nNews Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news.\nThis is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.\nThis week, Google gave us our first taste of Android 16 with the developer preview for Pixel phones, the DOJ is proposing that Google sells Chrome to break up its monopoly, OPPO launched the Find X8 series running the latest MediaTek chip, Google may be looking to develop a Pixel Laptop with a twist, and a new Garmin smartwatch just leaked.\n\nRead more here.\nIn preparation for an earlier rollout schedule, Google dropped the first Android 16 developer preview, which is available now for eligible Pixel smartphones. The update, which is expected to hit stable in Q2 2025, doesn't brings a handful of notable changes and features, including notification cooldown, audio sharing (which first appeared in the Android 15 beta), an improved desktop mode, and more.\nNewer Pixel phones are eligible for the update, which surprisingly includes the Pixel 6 series, which ended support for OS upgrades in October. It's a good sign that suggest there's a possibility that they will get the official Android 16 update, but Google could always change its mind. That also goes for any potential features found in the update.\nSince it's the first developer preview, things are bound to be very glitchy, so we don't recommend installing it unless you're a developer and/or know what you're doing.\n\nRead more here.\nReceive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Android Central team straight to your inbox!\nAfter a judge ruled earlier this year that Google holds a monopoly on search, the Justice Department has filed a proposal to break up the company, which includes selling off Chrome. As a significant part of Google's suite of apps and services, Google has understandably taken issue with this proposal, publishing a blog post about how the \"staggering\" proposal would \"harm consumers.\"\n\"DOJ’s proposal would literally require us to install not one but two separate choice screens before you could access Google Search on a Pixel phone you bought,\" says Kent Walker, Google's president of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, explaining that a proposed Technical Committee would hold hold \"enormous power\" over the online experience.\nThe blog post outlines a number of ways the proposal would \"break\" a range of Google's products, stating that it would create a worse experience for consumers. Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand also explains how selling Chrome may not work as well as the DOJ hopes. In response, Walker says Google will offer its own proposals next month.\n\nRead more here.\nIt's still 2024, but the 2025 flagships are already here, and OPPO is getting ahead of the game with the Find X8 series. The OPPO Find X8 and Find X8 Pro are nearly identical, although the standard model has a smaller 6.6-inch OLED display and a 5630mAh battery. The Pro model sports a 6.78-inch OLED display and a 5910mAh battery.\nFurthermore, the Find X8 has three 50MP cameras while the Find X8 Pro has four, with an additional periscope telephoto lens for 6x optical zoom.\nBoth phones are powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400, which competes directly with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and offers a new NPU with 80% faster LLM prompts and 100% more performant diffusion generation. You get a choice of 12 or 16GB of RAM with the X8, while the X8 Pro is only offered with 16GB. There's also support for magnetic charging, but you'll need a separate case for that.\nFor our impressions on OPPO's latest flagship, check out our OPPO Find X8 Pro review.\n\nRead more here.\nThere are a few rumors going around about Google's plans in the near future, which may no longer include the Pixel Tablet 2. However, one rumor points to what could be a Pixel Laptop, and it may not run ChromeOS as we would expect. According to Mishaal Rahman, Google is working on a \"multi-year project to fully turn Chrome OS into Android.\"\nGoogle already seems to be laying down the groundwork to make this happen, as it recently started merging \"portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of ChromeOS.\" This is apparently being done to accelerate development, particularly with AI features. Still, that won't be ready for \"quite some time.\"\nAs for the Pixel Laptop, it seems it may be a high-end Android device that is meant to compete more with the likes of the iPad. Only time will tell if the rumors of a laptop are true and whether it will indeed be able to adequately compete.\n\nRead more here.\nIt's been a minute since Garmin launched the last Instinct model, but we may not be waiting long for a new one. A Reddit post seems to show what's allegedly the Garmin Instinct 3, with what looks like an MIP two-window display. There's also an indicator under the display noting that it's a solar watch, which can help extend the battery life thanks to the built-in solar panel overlay.\nThe design resembles a somewhat sleeker Instinct Crossover, but the image clearly shows \"Garmin Instinct 3\" on the bottom. For now, it's unclear if the image is really the Garmin Instinct 3, but it wouldn't be the first time the watch has been spotted, so we'll see. It may not appeal to many athletes like other Garmin watches do, but the rugged design and solar capability may appeal to the more outdoorsy types.\nThose are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on:\nDerrek is the managing editor of Android Central, helping to guide the site's editorial content and direction to reach and resonate with readers, old and new, who are just as passionate about tech as we are. He's been obsessed with mobile technology since he was 12, when he discovered the Nokia N90, and his love of flip phones and new form factors continues to this day. As a fitness enthusiast, he has always been curious about the intersection of tech and fitness. When he's not working, he's probably working out.\nMotorola is finally letting you try its new Moto AI features, but only on select phones\nGoogle could make lock screen notifications less obtrusive in Android 15 QPR2\nI'm hyped over Dbrand's Black Friday sales, especially the leather skins\nAndroid Central is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Die Betroffenen sollen für Firmen arbeiten, die auf Embargolisten der USA und der EU stehen. Unsere Recherchen zeigen jedoch, dass dies offenbar nur auf wenige der Beschuldigten zutrifft und solche Embargos die Open-Source-Nutzung nicht verbieten.\nEnde Oktober 2024 hat Linux-Chef Linus Torvalds einen Patch seines Stellvertreters Greg Kroah-Hartman freigegeben, der elf russische Software-Entwickler von der sogenannten Maintainer-Liste löscht.

Die offizielle Begründung für die Löschung lautete zunächst lapidar: \"aufgrund verschiedener Konformitätsanforderungen\".\nDie fehlende Erklärung ließ Gerüchte und Spekulationen ins Kraut schießen und heizte Diskussionen in Foren an. Linux-Entwickler James Bottomley, langjähriges hochrangiges Mitglied verschiedener Komitees der Linux Foundation, stellte klar, dass die gestrichenen Entwickler im Verdacht stünden, für Firmen zu arbeiten, die auf den Wirtschaftssanktionslisten der USA und der EU stehen.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        Ein Team, das sich Flutter-Foundation nennt, hat Googles Flutter geforkt, da ihm die Kommunikation mit dem Kernteam zu träge war.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Ko Thongtawat / Shutterstock.com)\n    \nUnter dem Namen Flock ist ein Fork von Googles Flutter erschienen. Das für Flock verantwortliche Team nennt sich auf GitHub Flutter-Foundation und möchte die Weiterentwicklung des Frameworks vorantreiben.\nFlutter ist ein Framework für die Cross-Plattform-Entwicklung, das auf die ebenfalls von Google entwickelte Programmiersprache Dart setzt. Es deckt das Web, die mobilen Betriebssysteme Android und iOS sowie die Desktop-Plattformen Linux, Windows und macOS ab. Der Blogbeitrag zum Start von Flock beklagt, dass die Kernentwickler von Flutter nicht mit den Wünschen derjenigen mithalten könne, die Anwendungen mit Flutter entwickeln.\nAnfragen zu Bugs und Feature-Wünschen bleiben laut dem Verfasser des Blogbeitrags teilweise jahrelang liegen. Er berichtet von Fällen aus eigener Erfahrung, in denen er Rückmeldungen zu einem Ticket erhalten habe, als er schon lange nicht mehr an dem Projekt gearbeitet hatte. Das führte dazu, dass er sich an die für den Bugfix notwendigen Details nicht mehr erinnerte.\nDie Weiterentwicklung der Desktop-Plattformen Linux, macOS und Windows habe besonders unter den Engpässen gelitten. Sie befänden sich lediglich im Maintenance-Modus. Insgesamt sei die Flutter-Community groß genug, um bei der Entwicklung zu helfen. Erfahrene Flutter-Developer könnten als Externe zum Projekt beitragen. Schließlich ist Flutter ein Open-Source-Projekt.\nWarum beteiligen sich dann die Flock-Verantwortlichen dann nicht einfach an der Weiterentwicklung von Flutter? Laut ihren Aussagen gibt es eine große Diskrepanz zwischen der Eigendarstellung des Open-Source-Projekts und der Realität: Das Flutter-Team werbe regelmäßig mit vielen externen Beiträgen, aber in Wirklichkeit sei die Kommunikation mit dem Flutter-Team schwierig.\n\"Während einige Developer erfolgreich mit dem Flutter-Team zusammengearbeitet haben, fanden viele andere die Zusammenarbeit frustrierend, wenn nicht sogar unmöglich\", heißt es im Blogbeitrag. Insgesamt haben wohl 1500 Externe zu Flutter beigetragen, wozu jedoch auch Personen gehörten, \"die einmal vorbeigeschaut haben, um einen Tippfehler in der Dart-Dokumentation zu korrigieren\".\nFlock soll nun Abhilfe schaffen. Das Team hinter Flock bezeichnet den Fork als Flutter+, und es sei explizit nicht das Ziel, die Flutter-Community zu spalten. Der Fork soll stets auf dem neuesten Stand von Flutter bleiben und gleichzeitig alle wichtigen Bugfixes und von der Community gewünschte Features erhalten, die das Flutter-Team entweder nicht implementieren kann oder will.\nIm ersten Schritt hat das Flock-Team Flutter gespiegelt. Das Repository auf GitHub entspricht zum Start dem offiziellen Flutter-Repository. Dabei bleibt auch überall der Name Flutter erhalten. Neben dem Framework hat die Flutter Foundation auf GitHub die Flutter-Engine geforkt. Außerdem hat sie Repositorys für die Website und für Tools gestartet.\nNun lädt das Team zum Testen ein. Die Website der Flutter Foundation zeigt eine Kurzdokumentation, die durch die ersten Schritte von der Installation des Tools Flutter Version Manager (FVM) und der Konfiguration von Projekten für den Fork führt.\nDas Team sucht zudem nach Interessierten, die sich um den Review-Prozess kümmern. Schließlich sind einige Hauptverantwortliche für unterschiedliche Bereiche gesucht, darunter die Tools und die unterschiedlichen Zielplattformen Android, iOS, macOS, Windows und Linux.\nDie Pläne des Flock-Teams sind durchaus ambitioniert, aber ob der Fork es irgendwann schafft, für Business-Anwendungen interessant zu werden, ist fragwürdig. Er könnte früher auf dem Abstellgleis landen als Flutter auf dem Google-Friedhof.\nAuf Reddit ist die Reaktion auf den Fork fast durchweg negativ, von \"hilfreicher wäre, wenn ihr zu Flutter beitragt, statt es zu forken\" über \"komplette Zeitverschwendung\" bis zu \"erinnert mich in einem Jahr daran, darüber zu lachen\". Die Reaktionen auf X sind zwar ebenfalls weitgehend kritisch, aber es gibt auch positive Resonanz. In den Antworten finden sich zudem auch Reaktionen, die die angeprangerten Mängel bei der Kommunikation mit dem Flutter-Team bestätigen.\n\n\n\n(rme)\n\n\n\n    montags und donnerstags - alles von heise developer\n  \n\n    Ausführliche Informationen zum Versandverfahren und zu Ihren\n    Widerrufsmöglichkeiten erhalten Sie in unserer\n    Datenschutzerklärung.\n  \n\n        Immer informiert bleiben: Klicken Sie auf das Plus-Symbol an einem Thema, um diesem zu folgen.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        Passend zum neuen Windows Server 2025 hat Microsoft sein System Center 2025 freigegeben. Neben vielen Security-Updates gibt es Cloud-Management für on Premises.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Bild erstellt mit KI in Bing Designer durch heise online / dmk)\n    \nSystem Center 2025 ist allgemein verfügbar: Microsoft hat seine Administrationssoftware gleichzeitig mit dem neuen Windows Server 2025 veröffentlicht. Die Updates teilen sich hauptsächlich in die drei Bereiche Infrastrukturmanagement, Sicherheit und Modernisierung. System Center (SC) besteht aus mehreren Komponenten: Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM), Data Protection Manager (SCDPM), Operations Manager (SCOM), Service Manager (SCSM) und Orchestrator (SCO).\nDer VMM 2025 kann jetzt mit virtuellen Maschinen umgehen, die auf einem Azure-Stack-HCI-23H2-Cluster laufen. Außerdem lassen sich mit VMM 2025 \"aktuelle Linux-Distributionen\" verwalten – welche genau, geht aus der Ankündigung nicht hervor. Die Migration von VMware-VMs zu Windows Server mit VMM hat Microsoft ebenfalls überarbeitet; der Prozess soll jetzt besser skalieren. Zudem kann DPM ab Version 2025 mit der SharePoint Subscription Edition umgehen und fügt Support für Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) bei VMware-VMs hinzu.\nIm Bereich Sicherheit kommt der Support für TLS 1.3 hinzu, gleichzeitig hat Microsoft den Einsatz des Credential Security Support Provider Protocol (CredSSP) und NTLM für die Authentifizierung reduziert. DPM 2025 kann Anmeldeinformationen auf Wunsch im Azure Key Vault speichern, was auch für On-Premises-Umgebungen gilt. So will Microsoft die Datensicherheit seiner Nutzer erhöhen. SCO 2025 kann mit Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) umgehen, womit Administratoren nicht mehr Passwörter zwischen unterschiedlichen Diensten händisch synchronisieren müssen. Neu ist ferner der Support für OLE DB 19 in DPM und SCO.\nBereits 2023 hatte Microsoft Azure Arc für VMM eingeführt, der Support umfasst jetzt ebenfalls Windows Server 2025 inklusive Hotpatching. Wer weiterhin Windows Server 2012/R2 einsetzen will, kann über das Azure-Arc-VMM die Extended Security Updates (ESUs) buchen. Über ein Azure-Arc-VMM lassen sich auch On-Premises-Systeme starten, stoppen und neu starten. Ferner können Administratoren lokale VMs erstellen, ihre Größe verändern, skalieren und entfernen. All das funktioniert per Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC), das effektiv das abgekündigte Windows Azure Pack ersetzt. Außerdem entfernt Microsoft die Azure Profiles sowie System Center Service Provider Foundation (SPF) aus VMM, da Azure Arc beides abdeckt.\nEin Überblick aller neuen Features findet sich im System Center Blog. Hinsichtlich der Lizenzen betont Microsoft, dass Nutzer über das neue System Center 2025 ihre komplette IT-Infrastruktur verwalten können – separate Management-Tools seien nicht mehr notwendig. Es gibt zwei Editionen: Standard ab 1323 US-Dollar und Datacenter ab 3607 US-Dollar. Die Preise richten sich allerdings nach vielen Parametern, Details finden sich auf der Produktseite.\n\n\n\n(fo)\n\n\n\n    Alle Themen der kommenden iX im Überblick.

The trust is responsible for Arrowe Park Hospital, Clatterbridge Hospital, and Wirral Women and Children’s Hospital. It also provides some services at St Catherine’s Health Centre, Tranmere and Victoria Central Health Centre, Wallasey.[2]\nThe UK healthcare provider suffered a cyberattack that impacted its systems forcing the healthcare organization to postpone appointments and scheduled procedures. In response to the security breach, the company isolated some of its systems and took part of its IT infrastructure offline.\nWUTH is still facing disruption following the cyberattack.\n“We are working hard to rectify the issue after a major incident was declared at the Trust earlier this week following a targeted cyber security issue.” reads a statement published by Wirral University Teaching Hospital.\n“After detecting suspicious activity, as a precaution, we isolated our systems to ensure that the problem did not spread. This resulted in some IT systems being offline. We have reverted to our business continuity processes and are using paper rather than digital in the areas affected. We are working closely with the national cyber security services and we are planning to return to normal services at the earliest opportunity.\n“While services continue to be available, there has been disruption to planned services, for example, some scheduled appointments are affected.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        Protagonisten von Open Source wollen eine leistungsstarke offene KI-Welt aufbauen. Red Hat wagt sich vor, doch der Weg dürfte noch weit sein.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Bild erstellt mit KI in Bing Designer durch heise online / dmk)\n    \nDie KI-Plattform OpenShift AI erhält in Version 2.15 etliche neue Funktionen, darunter eine Model Registry als zentrale Verwaltung der Modelle. Damit kann man prädiktive sowie generative KI-Modelle, Metadaten und Modell-Artefakte gemeinsam nutzen, versionieren, bereitstellen und kontrollieren. Das hat Hersteller Red Hat angekündigt. OpenShift AI ist eine KI- und Machine-Learning-Plattform für die Entwicklung und den Betrieb KI-gestützter Anwendungen in einer Hybrid-Cloud-Umgebung. Zu ihren Aufgaben gehören Datenerfassung und -aufbereitung, das Modelltraining, die Feinabstimmung, die Modellbereitstellung, das Monitoring sowie die Hardwarebeschleunigung.\nEine weitere Neuerung in OpenShift AI 2.15 ist Data Drift Detection. Die Funktion erkennt Änderungen in der Verteilung von Eingabedaten für bereits im Einsatz befindliche ML-Modelle. Drift Detection warnt Data Scientists, sobald die Live-Daten der Modellvorhersagen erheblich von den Trainingsdaten abweichen. Da die Eingabedaten kontinuierlich überwacht werden, lässt sich die Zuverlässigkeit des Modells überprüfen und man kann das Modell gegebenenfalls an die realen Daten anpassen. Die ebenfalls neue Bias Detection hilft, eine faire und unvoreingenommene KI zu entwickeln. Das Tool soll nicht nur aufzeigen, ob die Modelle auf Grundlage der Trainingsdaten unvoreingenommen sind, sondern auch die Fairness der Modelle in der Praxis überwachen.\nEin weiteres neues Feature ist Fine-Tuning mit Low Rank Adaption (LoRA). Damit lässt sich eine schnellere Feinabstimmung von LLMs wie Llama 3 realisieren. Die neue Unterstützung von NVIDIA NIM beschleunigt die verteilten Bereitstellung von KI-Anwendungen mittels Microservices. NIM ist Teil der NVIDIA AI Enterprise Software Plattform und verbessert das Verteilen von GenKI-Anwendungen. Neben NVIDIA unterstützt OpenShift aber auch AMD-GPUs. Das ermöglicht den Zugriff auf ein AMD ROCm Workbench Image zur Verwendung von AMD-GPUs für die Modellentwicklung. Die Neuerung erlaubt auch den Zugriff auf Images, die für Serving- und Trainings-/Tuning-Anwendungsfälle mit AMD-GPUs einsetzbar sind. Damit stehen zusätzliche Optionen für den Einsatz von GPUs zur Verbesserung der Leistung bei rechenintensiven Aktivitäten zur Verfügung. Die neue Version von Red Hat OpenShift AI arbeitet außerdem mit KServe Model Cars: Repositorys der Open Container Initiative (OCI) lassen sich als Option für die Speicherung und den Zugriff von containerisierten Modellversionen hinzufügen.\nRed Hat versteht sich als anwendungsneutraler Plattform-Anbieter und ist somit gefordert, auch den plattformunabhängigen Betrieb von KI-Modellen zuzulassen. Doch hier gibt es zunehmend ein Problem: Die großen Sprachmodelle sind stark an die Hardware gebunden, auf der sie laufen. Um dieses Problem zu lösen, hat Red Hat vor Kurzem Neural Magic akquiriert, ein Spin-off des MIT, und will nun eine Art „Open Hybrid AI“ auf den Markt bringen. Dazu müssen die LLMs so weit abstrahiert werden, dass sie auf jeder beliebigen Plattform lauffähig sind – in Anlehnung an virtuelle Maschinen „virtuelle LLMs“ (vLLMs) genannt. Das Konzept dafür wurde an der University of California in Berkeley entwickelt und soll KI-Modelle auf verschiedenen Hardwareplattformen erlauben, darunter Prozessoren von AMD, Intel und Nvidia sowie benutzerdefinierte Chips von Amazon Web Services und Google.\nDoch das ist nicht das einzige Problem: Die leistungsstärksten LLMs benötigen extrem viel Rechenleistung – und der Bedarf steigt exponentiell an. Andererseits sind die großen Universalmodelle für die meisten Firmenanwendungen überdimensioniert. Red Hat setzt auf „Small Language Model“ (SML), also Modelle, die für einfache KI-Anwendungsfälle geeignet sind. Dabei wird ein großes Modell so spezifisch trainiert, dass sich damit bestimmte Anwendungen zufriedenstellend abarbeiten lassen. Red Hat setzt dafür InstructLab ein. Zusammen mit RHEL und einem Granite-Modell von Red Hats Mutterkonzern IBM kann man damit nahezu beliebige Modelle so speziell trainieren, dass sie exakt zu einem vorgegebenen Anwendungsfall passen. Diese Modelle benötigen wesentlich weniger Rechenleistung, sodass sie auf dem eigenen Server oder sogar auf einem der neuen KI-PCs laufen können. Hierbei arbeitet Red Hat eng mit Intel zusammen.\nIBM hat sein Sprachmodell Granite-7B in InstructLab integriert, sodass jeder neue Fähigkeiten und Kenntnisse hinzufügen und sie für die spezifischen Anforderungen eines Unternehmens anpassen kann – ohne dass etwas von dem verloren geht, womit das Modell zuvor trainiert wurde. Über die Performance sagt IBM, dass das ursprüngliche Trainieren der Granite-Codemodelle für die Übersetzung von COBOL in Java 14 Feinabstimmungsrunden benötigte, die insgesamt neun Monate dauerten. Mit InstructLab konnte das Team mit nur einer Runde und einem Zeitbedarf von einer Woche neu abgestimmte COBOL-Fähigkeiten hinzufügen und eine bessere Leistung erzielen.\nInsgesamt wird die Nutzung von Open Source für KI noch kritisch gesehen. Das betrifft etwa die Unabhängigkeit von großen Unternehmen. \"Ohne die großen KI-Unternehmen, wie Microsoft, Facebook, Google und Tesla, kann sich KI nicht weiterentwickeln – das trifft insbesondere auch auf den KI-Einsatz mit Open-Source-Modellen zu\", sagt Hans Roth, Red Hats Senior Vice President und General Manager EMEA. Das liegt vor allem daran, dass für die Entwicklung und Pflege der LLMs immense Ressourcen nötig sind, die die Community nicht bereitstellen kann.\nAber auch unabhängig davon ist Open Source noch keine gleichwertige Alternative zu proprietären Produkten. Die LF AI \u0026 Data Foundation, eine auf KI spezialisierte Unterorganisation der Linux Foundation, hat sich intensiv mit diesem Thema beschäftigt. Bei einer Vergleichsuntersuchung schnitten die aktuellen Open-Source-Modelle bei den meisten Aufgaben schlechter ab als Closed-Source-Modelle. Das betrifft auch die Security. So ergab eine Analyse mithilfe von Code-Schwachstellenscannern wie Bandit, FlawFinder und Semgrep bei über 100.000 Open-Source-Modellen auf Hugging Face und GitHub, dass über 30 Prozent der Modelle schwerwiegende Schwachstellen aufweisen. Bei geschlossenen Modellen sind es in der Regel wesentlich weniger Sicherheitsrisiken.\nEin spezielles Problem der Open-Source-Nutzung für Künstliche Intelligenz ist auch die verwirrende Einordnung. So beklagt die Organisation, dass viele Anbieter „Openwashing“ betreiben: Sie behaupten, ihr Produkt sei Open Source, obwohl ihre Produkte den anerkannten Prinzipien und Freiheiten von Open Source zuwiderlaufen. Eine Open-Source-KI ist nach Definition der LF AI \u0026 Data Foundation ein KI-System, das folgende Bedingungen erfüllt: \"Es kann für jeden beliebigen Zweck und ohne Erlaubnis genutzt werden, die Funktionsweise des Systems kann frei zugänglich untersucht werden, das System lässt sich für jeden Zweck modifizieren, einschließlich Änderungen an den Ausgaben und das System kann mit oder ohne Änderungen für andere freigegeben werden, damit diese es für jeden beliebigen Zweck verwenden können. Diese Vorgaben gelten sowohl für ein voll funktionsfähiges System als auch für einzelne Elemente eines Systems.“ Modelle, die diese Kriterien erfüllen, sind Pythia (Eleuther AI), OLMo (AI2), Amber, CrystalCoder (LLM360) und T5 (Google). Es gibt aber noch ein paar weitere, die auch dazu gehören könnten, wenn sie ihre Lizenzen oder rechtlichen Bedingungen ändern würden. Dazu gehören BLOOM (BigScience), Starcoder2 (BigCode) und Falcon (TII). Unvereinbar mit den Open-Source-Prinzipien sind auf jeden Fall Llama2 (Meta), Grok (X/Twitter), Phi-2 (Microsoft) und Mixtral (Mistral).\nMit der Definition spricht die Foundation indirekt eines der größten Probleme der Closed-Source-Modelle an: Die Intransparenz der Algorithmen und der genutzten Daten. Das kann möglicherweise sogar zu erheblichen Rechtsproblemen führen. Hier sehen sich die Open-Source-Anbieter klar im Vorteil. \"Unsere gesamte Software ist garantiert frei von Ansprüchen Dritter – und das betrifft auch unsere KI-Lösungen“, lautet das starke Argument von Hans Roth zugunsten Open Source.\n\n\n\n(tiw)\n\n\n\n    Alle Themen der kommenden iX im Überblick.

    "content": "Early access program launched for early-adopters\nFramework make the most exciting laptops around —I don’t own one to be able to say they’re good, but the modular components, and upgradeable and repairable ethos is unlike anything else.\nAs news earlier this year that owners would be able to swap their Intel-based mainboard for a RISC-V mainboard underscores.\nWell, there’s now an update on that front.\nDeepComputing (who make the Ubuntu-powered DC-ROMA II laptop \u0026 Pad II tablet) has launched an early access program for its DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard for the Framework Laptop 13.\nThe mainboard is also compatible with the  Framework and Cooler Master Case (which lets mainboards be used as a desktop PC). \nSpecs wise, it’s built around a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC with SiFive U74 cores. This chip is used in the Milk-V Mars SBC, which also runs Ubuntu.\nThe catch is that this early-access program is open to enterprise and business customers, rather than would-be Linux community RISC-V developers (although other options exist those, including the aforementioned devices and many from Pine64).\nSince RISC-V doesn’t currently deliver the kind of performance or software compatibility that casual consumers and intrepid enthusiasts may want, the exclusivity is a necessary signal to send. \nUbuntu 24.04 is supported, as is Fedora Workstation 41. \nGordan Markuš, Director of Silicon Alliances at Canonical says the company’s “…collaboration with DeepComputing and their early adopters highlights our shared commitment to openness in computing and robust Linux support for the RISC-V community.“\nWhile Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linux Foundation fellow and well-known Linux kernel devs says that “collaborations like these are essential to driving forward both Linux and RISC-V, as they enable early adopters to help shape the future of open-source hardware.”\nThe DeepComputing RISC-V mainboard costs from $199. That’s the basic tier price which includes the mainboard itself, a Coolmaster case to use it as a mini PC, 2x USB-C expansion cards, and a 64GB SD card (since it has no on-board storage) only.\nThe standard tier ($299) include more expansion cards (USB-A, HDMI, Wi-Fi + antennas); the pro tier ($368) swaps the Coolmaster case for an actual Framework Laptop 13; and the enterprise tier gives you 2 boards, a laptop and a PC case, and everything else.\nThose prices rise considerably if choosing to include “added-value” extras – mainly a set of discount codes for other products and services, the opportunity to provide feedback to help shape the next-generation version, and a discount when it launches.\nIf you own a Framework Laptop 13 (or are debating buying one in the near future) and you’re interested in RISC-V, go check out the release announcement for more details, or skip to the DeepComputing store to see if you’re eligible to buy.\nThanks Marta\n\nBy buying me a $2 coffee, you’re directly funding continued independent coverage of the Linux ecosystem—content for you, and for everyone!\n© 2024 Ohso Media\n",

Today, we’re pleased to help drive cloud-native evolution further into the next-generation of IT with our intent to contribute a comprehensive set of container tools to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), including bootc, Buildah, Composefs, Podman, Podman Desktop and Skopeo.\nUpon acceptance by the CNCF, the contributed tools will become hosted projects – alongside technologies like Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm and many more – and part of a vendor-neutral foundation aligned with the projects’ technical interests. The tools will start as Sandbox projects, allowing end-users to contribute, collaborate, grow the project communities and mature the technology.\nWhile already popular tools with strong user bases - with Podman Desktop having been downloaded more than 1.5 million times and Podman having 23.6k GitHub Stars - we believe as CNCF-hosted projects, these tools will continue to meet the needs of developers today while paving the way for container technologies to grow organically and evolve to meet the dynamic needs of tomorrow.\nArtificial intelligence is exposing technological and operational gaps in the technology industry more than ever. To meet the changing needs of developers, Red Hat has been working to not only drive innovation at the workload level -- but also into core functions to better enable end-users to build and run these advanced and intelligent workloads.\nContainers are a fundamental part of these workloads, existing at the center of today’s cloud-native infrastructure with Linux forming the core of each respective container. Through the contribution of these cloud-native container tools, users have better and more consistent access between Linux and Kubernetes. With Linux as the foundation, these tools provide users an end-to-end cloud-native stack to build, deploy and manage containers at scale across the hybrid cloud.\nCustomers who use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) can utilize Podman, Buildah, Skopeo and more, knowing they are optimized for RHEL and RHEL supports them in production. The contributed container tools are the building blocks many cloud-native workloads rely on and Red Hat is committed to each project’s future as an open source technology, bringing flexibility, accessibility and enhanced security features to container development.\nOpen source is at the heart of everything Red Hat does, and we believe making the code available is just the first step. It’s the collaboration that truly defines open source and leads to groundbreaking innovation. Newer workloads are forcing application developers to innovate in ways that open source is uniquely positioned to help guide.\nProjects like Podman are at the center of this innovation for container technologies and  Podman Desktop makes it accessible to the developers. That is why, while already a popular project, Podman is being submitted for contribution at the Sandbox level. Podman as a Sandbox project allows for the community to grow organically, fostering collaboration and growing the diversity of contributors and maintainers - ultimately making it a stronger technology. We believe the CNCF is the place to make this innovation happen in the open.\nMore information about these projects, including how to get involved, is below:\nSource: https://github.com/containers/podmanSource: https://github.com/containers/buildahSource: https://github.com/containers/skopeoCommunity: https://podman.io/community \nSource: https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktopCommunity: https://discord.com/invite/x5GzFF6QH4\nSource: https://github.com/containers/bootcCommunity: https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussionsMatrix: https://matrix.to/#/#bootc:fedoraproject.org\nThe world’s leading provider of enterprise open source software solutions\nRed Hat is the world’s leading provider of enterprise open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver reliable and high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.\nRed Hat helps customers integrate new and existing IT applications, develop cloud-native applications, standardize on our industry-leading operating system, and automate, secure, and manage complex environments.

Nuove possibilità per schede grafiche AMD su sistemi embedded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n            a cura di\n            \n                                    \n    Giulia Serena\n\n                        \n\n        \n\n                Editor\n            \nUn Raspberry Pi 5 collegato a una GPU esterna AMD Radeon è stato utilizzato per accelerare l'esecuzione di un modello linguistico di grandi dimensioni (LLM). L'esperto Jeff Geerling ha dimostrato come sfruttare il supporto dell'API Vulkan per ottenere prestazioni di intelligenza artificiale accelerate dalla GPU sul piccolo computer.\nQuesto esperimento rappresenta un importante passo avanti nell'utilizzo del Raspberry Pi per applicazioni di intelligenza artificiale avanzate. Finora le capacità del dispositivo in questo ambito erano limitate, ma l'uso di una GPU esterna apre nuove possibilità.\n\n                    Valido dal 21 Novembre al 02 Dicembre\n                     - \n                    \n                    Risparmia su centinaia di prodotti!\n                \n\n                        Segui il Black Friday con Tom's Hardware!\n                    \n\n                        Le migliori offerte selezionate dai più grandi store online con sconti fino al 70%!\n                    \nGeerling ha utilizzato un adattatore per collegare la GPU AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT al Raspberry Pi 5 tramite il connettore PCIe. Il setup software ha richiesto la compilazione di un kernel Linux personalizzato e l'installazione di driver e patch sperimentali per abilitare il supporto Vulkan.\nI test hanno mostrato prestazioni paragonabili a quelle di un Mac Studio con chip M1 Max, con un consumo energetico molto inferiore. Il sistema Raspberry Pi + eGPU è in grado di generare 40-60 token al secondo, sufficienti per molte applicazioni di AI domestiche.\nQuesta dimostrazione apre interessanti scenari per l'uso del Raspberry Pi in ambito AI:\nSebbene la configurazione sia ancora complessa, in futuro potrebbe diventare più accessibile permettendo a molti appassionati di sperimentare con l'AI su Raspberry Pi. Restano da valutare aspetti come stabilità e compatibilità software nel lungo periodo.\n\n\nGeerling ha commentato: \"Questo setup offre prestazioni quasi paragonabili a un Mac Studio M1 Max, ma a una frazione del costo se si hanno già alcuni componenti\". Il costo totale stimato è di circa 700$ per un sistema nuovo completo.\nL'esperimento dimostra ancora una volta la versatilità e il potenziale del Raspberry Pi, che continua a trovare nuovi e sorprendenti utilizzi grazie alla creatività della sua community di appassionati e sviluppatori.\nInsomma, il Raspberry Pi, il popolare microcomputer nato nel 2012, continua a stupire per la sua versatilità e le sue potenzialità. La sua storia affonda le radici nell'obiettivo di creare un dispositivo economico per insegnare l'informatica nelle scuole, ma ha rapidamente conquistato appassionati e maker di tutto il mondo.\nIl nome \"Raspberry Pi\" ha un'origine curiosa: \"Raspberry\" (lampone) segue la tradizione di dare nomi di frutta ai computer, mentre \"Pi\" si riferisce al linguaggio di programmazione Python. La Raspberry Pi Foundation, l'organizzazione no-profit che lo ha creato, non immaginava certo il successo che avrebbe avuto.\nNel corso degli anni, il Raspberry Pi è stato utilizzato per i progetti più disparati: dalle stazioni meteorologiche domestiche ai sistemi domotici, passando per retrogaming e media center. La sua capacità di adattarsi a diversi scenari lo ha reso un punto di riferimento per hobbisti e professionisti.\nL'evoluzione del Raspberry Pi ha portato a modelli sempre più potenti, ma sempre mantenendo la filosofia di base: basso costo e apertura. L'ultima frontiera, come dimostrato dall'esperimento con la GPU esterna, è l'intelligenza artificiale, aprendo scenari che fino a poco tempo fa sembravano impossibili per un dispositivo così piccolo ed economico.\nL'esperimento con la GPU esterna per l'AI rappresenta, dunque, solo l'ultimo capitolo di una storia di innovazione continua, dimostrando come il piccolo computer nato per l'educazione sia diventato un vero e proprio laboratorio di sperimentazione tecnologica a livello globale.\n\n    \n\t\t\t\tFonte dell'articolo: www.tomshardware.com\n\t\t\t\n\nNon perdere gli\n        ultimi\n        aggiornamenti\nAdvertisement\n\n                            \n                        \n\n                        Tom's Hardware - Testata giornalistica associata all'USPI Unione Stampa Periodica\n                        Italiana,\n                        registrata presso il Tribunale di Milano, nr. 285 del 9/9/2013 - Direttore: Andrea Ferrario\n                        \n                        3LABS S.R.L. • Via Dante 16 - Milano (MI) 20121\n                        CF/P.IVA: 04146420965 - REA: MI - 1729249 - Capitale Sociale: 10.000 euro\n                        \n                        © 2024 3Labs Srl.

PHDays Fest 2\nXakep #301. Магия виртуализации\nXakep #300. Номер триста\nЧи­тай так­же: «По­луось. Как OS/2 изме­нила судь­бу Microsoft и откры­ла дорогу для Windows».\nСе­реди­на девянос­тых ста­ла для кор­порации IBM не луч­шим пери­одом в ее исто­рии. С одной сто­роны, соз­данный этой ком­пани­ей стан­дарт пер­сональ­ных компь­юте­ров IBM PC заво­евал зна­читель­ную долю рын­ка во всем мире, с дру­гой — незави­симые про­изво­дите­ли кле­пали IBM-сов­мести­мые пер­сонал­ки и ком­плек­тующие для них мил­лион­ными тиража­ми, лишая при­были самого авто­ра тех­нологии. Ко все­му про­чему спе­циаль­но раз­работан­ная для этих машин опе­раци­онная сис­тема OS/2 стре­митель­но теряла популяр­ность под натис­ком Microsoft Windows, прев­ратив­шей­ся в самую рас­простра­нен­ную ОС на нашей пла­нете. Впо­ру задумать­ся над сво­им будущим.\nИ в IBM задума­лись. Выход из сло­жив­шегося тех­нологи­чес­кого и финан­сового тупика там уви­дели в сме­не аппа­рат­ной плат­формы: если вмес­то про­цес­соров Intel пер­сонал­ки IBM PC будут исполь­зовать мик­росхе­мы PowerPC, это поз­волит ком­пании, во‑пер­вых, сос­редото­чить в сво­их руках про­изводс­тво железа, а во‑вто­рых, выпус­тить под эту тех­нологи­чес­кую плат­форму собс­твен­ную опе­раци­онку, что, в свою оче­редь, поз­волит писать и про­давать софт для нее.\nКор­порация IBM вмес­те с Motorola и Apple уже дав­но при­нима­ла непос­редс­твен­ное учас­тие в раз­работ­ке RISC-архи­тек­туры PowerPC, потому эти про­цес­соры были для нее, что называ­ется, «род­ными». К 1994 году ком­пания Apple пла­ниро­вала пол­ностью отка­зать­ся от про­цес­соров Motorola серии 68k в поль­зу PowerPC, что слу­жило наг­лядным при­мером, доказы­вающим прин­ципи­аль­ную воз­можность такой радикаль­ной сме­ны архи­тек­туры. К сло­ву, зна­читель­но поз­же Apple про­дела­ла подоб­ный фокус еще дваж­ды: в 2006-м, миг­рировав с PPC на плат­форму Intel, и в 2020-м, перей­дя с Intel на чипы Apple Silicon. Что же каса­ется опе­раци­онной сис­темы, которую мож­но было бы исполь­зовать на новых компь­юте­рах IBM, то работа над ней началась еще в 1991 году. В общем, казалось, что для реали­зации это­го амби­циоз­ного про­екта звез­ды скла­дыва­лись самым бла­гоп­рият­ным обра­зом.\nВ 1990-м, ког­да IBM и Microsoft окон­чатель­но прек­ратили сот­рудни­чес­тво по раз­работ­ке OS/2, архи­тек­торы пер­вой из этих двух ком­паний приш­ли к выводу, что эво­люция опе­раци­онных сис­тем дви­жет­ся куда‑то не туда. Унас­ледован­ная еще из шес­тидеся­тых парадиг­ма про­цедур­ного прог­рамми­рова­ния делала раз­работ­ку ОС чрез­вычай­но тру­доем­ким и ресур­созат­ратным про­цес­сом. Прог­раммис­ты тра­тили мас­су вре­мени не толь­ко на написа­ние кода: коман­ды раз­работ­чиков, пог­лощен­ные исправ­лени­ем оши­бок и внед­рени­ем новых фун­кций, не успе­вали соз­давать сов­мести­мые с этой ОС при­ложе­ния. Каж­дая опе­раци­онная сис­тема сущес­тво­вала в изо­ляции и не поз­воляла исполь­зовать при­ложе­ния из дру­гой эко­сис­темы. Архи­тек­торы IBM меч­тали об «уни­вер­саль­ной» плат­форме, в которой мож­но было бы запус­кать прог­раммы, соз­данные и для DOS/Windows, и для OS/2, и для UNIX.\nЧто­бы воп­лотить эту меч­ту в реаль­ность, в IBM начали тру­дить­ся сра­зу в двух нап­равле­ниях. Во‑пер­вых, ком­пания решила пол­ностью сло­мать общепри­нятый тог­да цикл раз­работ­ки опе­раци­онных сис­тем, под­разуме­вав­ший выпуск нес­коль­ких аль­фа‑вер­сий, затем бета‑вер­сий, потом релиз‑кан­дидата и, наконец, релиза, пос­ле чего весь про­цесс пов­торял­ся с новой вер­сией ОС. Вмес­то это­го они решили рас­парал­лелить раз­работ­ку и тес­тирова­ние: в этом слу­чае тес­тиров­щики работа­ли с отдель­ными модуля­ми ОС, в то вре­мя как прог­раммис­ты занима­лись написа­нием новых ком­понен­тов и исправ­лени­ем багов в сущес­тву­ющих. Этот прин­цип получил наз­вание Grand Unified Theory of Systems (GUTS), или «боль­шая еди­ная теория сис­тем». Во‑вто­рых, в IBM начали соз­давать мик­рояд­ро для прин­ципи­аль­но новой опе­раци­онной сис­темы, отличной от OS/2. Идея была гран­диоз­ной: в IBM нацели­лись, ни мно­го ни мало, соз­дать еди­ную уни­фици­рован­ную архи­тек­туру для мно­жес­тва сущес­тву­ющих и будущих опе­раци­онных сис­тем мира.\nЭто мик­рояд­ро, получив­шее наз­вание IBM Microkernel, было задума­но как мас­шта­биру­емое, кросс‑плат­формен­ное и модуль­ное, с под­дер­жкой кли­ент‑сер­верной архи­тек­туры, при этом лицен­зировать пред­полага­лось не толь­ко бинар­ные фай­лы, но и исходный код. В IBM наде­ялись добить­ся уни­вер­саль­нос­ти, бла­года­ря которой это мик­рояд­ро мож­но было бы исполь­зовать как на нас­толь­ных компь­юте­рах, так и в мей­нфрей­мах, при­мер­но как сей­час ядро Linux лежит в осно­ве ОС и на мобиль­ных Android-устрой­ствах, и на пер­сонал­ках, и на сер­верах. За осно­ву в IBM взя­ли модифи­циро­ван­ный Open Software Foundation форк мик­рояд­ра Mach 3.0, соз­данно­го сот­рудни­ками уни­вер­ситета Кар­неги — Мел­лона Ричар­дом Рашидом и Эви Тевань­яном. Выбор был про­думан­ным: это же мик­рояд­ро поз­же ста­ло осно­вой для раз­работан­ного Apple ядра XNU, которое исполь­зует­ся в macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS и watchOS.\nПла­ны IBM были амби­циоз­ными. Работа­ющая на осно­ве IBM Microkernel опе­раци­онная сис­тема дол­жна была широко исполь­зовать биб­лиоте­ки и фрей­мвор­ки для упро­щения соз­дания прик­ладных прог­рамм, обес­печивать пол­ную обратную сов­мести­мость с уста­рев­шими и нас­леду­емы­ми сис­темами и при этом под­держи­вать как 32-бит­ный, так и 64-бит­ный режимы работы, при­чем парал­лель­но. Кро­ме того, новое мик­рояд­ро дол­жно было работать на нес­коль­ких аппа­рат­ных архи­тек­турах: PowerPC, ARM и x86, но от этих гран­диоз­ных пла­нов в ито­ге приш­лось отка­зать­ся, и пол­номас­штаб­ная под­дер­жка была реали­зова­на толь­ко для PPC.\nПо­верх мик­рояд­ра рас­полагал­ся слой обще­дос­тупных служб (Personality Neutral Services, PNS), обес­печива­ющий вза­имо­дей­ствие ядра и прик­ладных про­цес­сов в опе­раци­онной сис­теме. Ведущий архи­тек­тор IBM Пол Джи­ангарра, занимав­ший­ся про­екти­рова­нием этой ОС, писал, что слой PNS по задум­ке раз­работ­чиков вклю­чал не толь­ко низ­коуров­невые служ­бы фай­ловой сис­темы, вво­да‑вывода и драй­веров устрой­ств, но и высоко­уров­невые служ­бы, обес­печива­ющие работу сетево­го сте­ка и баз дан­ных. Счи­талось, что раз­мещение таких ори­енти­рован­ных на при­ложе­ния служб близ­ко к мик­рояд­ру повысит их эффектив­ность за счет сок­ращения количес­тва вызовов фун­кций.\nВ IBM при­дума­ли и собс­твен­ную модель драй­веров под наз­вани­ем Adaptive Driver Architecture (ADD) — пред­полага­лось, что она облегчит пор­тирова­ние драй­веров меж­ду раз­ными ОС, исполь­зующи­ми IBM Microkernel. По задум­ке раз­работ­чиков такие драй­веры дол­жны были стать частью инс­тру­мен­тария, обес­печива­юще­го перено­симость ОС: нап­ример, некото­рые из них мог­ли исполь­зовать­ся с целью под­дер­жки обо­рудо­вания, необ­ходимо­го для нор­маль­ной работы при­ложе­ний Windows и OS/2 на мик­рояд­ре IBM Microkernel.\nМатериалы из последних выпусков становятся доступны по отдельности только через два месяца после публикации.

    "content": "Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?\nIt’s never easy to recommend a foldable phone, especially when you consider the high asking price and the reports of hardware issues that keep eliciting long posts on Reddit. My personal experience also drives this reluctance, even though I’ve been using foldable phones consistently for half a decade now.\nEarly in 2023, the hinge on my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 gave up. The phone would no longer open fully. A few days after the problem first manifested, I noticed a glue-like material oozing from the hinge gap.\nI don’t remember it ever taking a nasty drop or even leaving my protective case since the setup day. Of course, I was disillusioned, and as our investigation later uncovered, there is no shortage of Samsung foldable enthusiasts feeling a similar sting in their wallets.\nSoon after the bad experience, I switched to a OnePlus Open — and it made me a folding phone believer once again.\nMy Digital Trends colleague, Tushar Mehta, wrote a deep dive on the OnePlus Open Apex Edition’s design philosophy, and I recommend that you check that out for a primer. In real life, this phone will arrest your attention, all thanks to that red vegan leather that offers a striking contrast to the metallic luster on the frame and hinge.\nThe foldable phone trend in the industry is saturated with brands using all varieties of steel and aluminum, with some claiming military-grade durability. OnePlus followed in Apple’s footsteps, but took some metallurgical liberties of its own.\nWhere Apple used a titanium alloy frame tinged with aluminum and vanadium, OnePlus took a different exotic route. The company has used titanium alloy and cobalt molybdenum alloy as the primary framework material. The company claims the former is lighter and sturdier compared to the various strains of stainless steel found on most other smartphones.\nOnePlus paid special attention to the phone’s most fragile element — the hinge assembly. The cobalt molybdenum alloy, for example, is touted to be four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel and far stronger than what rival foldable phones can claim.\nThe hinge spine plate, on the other hand, is made of a liquid metal derivative of amorphous zirconium alloy. In addition to raw material strength, it is said to offer high scratch and wear resistance. In a nutshell, the OnePlus Open is one of the most bewitchingly alluring phones out there, foldable or otherwise.\nI could make an exception for the pink Pixel 9, but only to honor my colleague, Christine Romero-Chan, who also drove the Pro model in the same shade. The in-hand feel is fittingly fantastic on the Apex Edition. OnePlus nailed what one would call the “normal” look and feel of a regular phone. The Pixel Fold was just too wide, while Samsung’s Galaxy Fold still flaunts its tall aspect ratio anomaly.\nOn a personal note, however, the reality has been more pleasing than mere brand rhetoric. The OnePlus Open has taken more bumps than I can remember. Nearly half a dozen times, the phone has even received a nice slap or kick as I tried to catch it after it slipped from the table, a pocket, or my grip.\nThere are scars across the phone’s frame, retelling my clumsy ways. But more importantly, they serve as a lived-in retelling of just how resilient the phone is.\nCracked rear shell, broken camera lens cover, and the usual aftermath, a shattered screen. The situation has improved over the years, but those are mostly reserved for flagship phones treated with the latest from Corning or AGC Dragontrail.\nThe status quo of foldables is still tightly lodged in the “handle with care” class. And no, there is no escape route from the expensive repair costs. OnePlus will charge a cool $510 to fix issues with the inner foldable panel, while Samsung will require $549 to fix its latest Galaxy Z Fold 6. Repairs are expensive, but thankfully, the OnePlus Open has held up remarkably well.\nThe OnePlus Open is a very good phone, regardless of whether you keep your activities limited to the “normal” cover screen or make the most of its tablet-like inner foldable screen. As a journalist, nearly half my job entails reading reports and papers.\nEver since I started using foldable phones, I’ve almost entirely ditched the Kindle, or any other reader for that matter. The only scenario where I picked up another device — like the excellent Boox Palma – was because e-readers are far easier on the eyes.\nOf course, watching videos is also a part of daily usage, but I am not particularly fond of pillarboxing, so there’s that. Binge-reading manga and comics? The OnePlus Open is perfect for it.\nAnother reason that the OnePlus Open has me hooked is the sheer joy of playing emulated games. Regardless of your taste in recreational digital content, the OLED screens (inside and outside) will serve you just fine. Hello, Dolby Vision support!\nIn fact, the Open Canvas system for running multiple apps side by side is still the best implementation of split-screen multitasking on a phone. Or a tablet. My colleague, Tushar, discovered his own niche utilitarian joy using the hands-free mode on the OnePlus Open.\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 powering the phone is still a mighty processor that can handle anything you would expect from a top-tier flagship phone. The phone’s triple-lens camera array is also quite powerful, and the results are good enough that I’ve never had second thoughts about picking it over the “Pro” iPhones.\nBinge-reading manga and comics? The OnePlus Open is perfect for it.\nThere are many neat features to play with, but my favorite is the Hasselblad wizardry, which you can access in XPAN mode. It tries to replicate pictures in the 24x65mm format, a signature trait of the 1998 Hasselblad XPAN camera.\nThe black-and-white panoramic shots captured in the XPAN mode are totally worth the effort, and they inject some effortless artistic soul into any frame. Of course, not having to worry about the storage space running out on the Apex Edition is just the cherry on top.\nThe OnePlus Open continues the brand’s steady inroads into a tighter security experience for smartphone users. With OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus Open, the company fortified security measures such as chip-level encryption, which is bundled together with another security measure within the Device Security Engine 3.0 package.\nEarlier this year, OnePlus became the first Android smartphone maker to join the App Defense Alliance (ADA). The brainchild of Google, Meta, and Microsoft aims to protect Android phones from the scourge of malware through mobile applications and other emerging threats. At the moment, ADA operates under the Linux Foundation.\nThe OnePlus Apex Edition, specifically, carries that momentum further, thanks to a special VIP mode that offers enhanced security and privacy. Broadly, it accomplishes a couple of things. First, it disables mic and camera access across the system. Second, it restricts ad-tracking by using hardware-level encryption.\nThe enhanced security measures come to life courtesy of a dedicated security chip and a shielded NFC chip, both of which have been certified by Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, which provides an industry standard for computing security.\nThis may not mean anything to some people, but for anyone who takes their smartphone security seriously, it’s a really nice touch — and yet another feather in the OnePlus Open’s cap.\nEither $1,700 (or $1,900 for the Apex Edition) is no small sum, and certainly not for a phone. For any sane mind hoping to give OnePlus that kind of dough, they better commit to using it for at least a few years. This phone has adequate hardware to stay competent, but for how long exactly?\nUnfortunately, OnePlus only promises upgrades through Android 17 for the OnePlus Open. For reference, Android 15 is now in the public domain. Consumer sentiments suggest that users seek longer update cycles on their phones. Market research firm Counterpoint says consumers are now holding on to their phones for longer.\nFor comparison, the Pixel 9 series will get OS for seven generations. Even the midrange OnePlus Nord 4 will eclipse the OnePlus Open in software updates. For OnePlus’ flagship foldable, and one that costs so much, longer software support would have been great to see.\nDurability is next in line, which is even more pronounced in the case of foldable. The OnePlus foldable only offers IPX4-tier ingress protection, while Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4 guarantees IP48-level dust and water shielding. I’ve used the OnePlus Open for a while now, and it hasn’t worried me with any kind of hardware factors, but accidents happen.\nThen there is the omission of yet another crucial convenience — wireless charging. Now, I would take fast wired charging any day over wireless charging support. The OnePlus Open certainly scores an ace on that front, allowing 67-watt wired charging. In the retail box, you get an 80W charging brick, which is a convenient surprise.\nBut I must admit, the convenience of wireless charging has spoiled me, and there’s some practical rationale behind that, too. I only have access to so many ports on my work desk or the coffee shops I frequent. Plus, with each passing year, we are moving around with more accessories that need charging.\nI have 3-in-1 wireless chargers in various shapes and sizes, but ultimately, they help me reduce the cable clutter and solve the port paucity problem. Almost every week, I have found myself placing the OnePlus Open on a wireless charging pad, only to realize that it was a vain effort.\nOverall, the OnePlus Open has proved to be the most rewarding phone I’ve used in a while. It’s also the phone that has been my daily driver for the longest spell in my career. The Apex Edition just happens to the best execution, a real flex of form and functionality.\nOnce again, it isn’t exactly cheap, and neither is the standard version. But if you’ve ever wondered how well a foldable phone holds up in the long run, this is the one-year review to help guide your purchase decision.\nThe OnePlus Open has proved to be the most rewarding phone I’ve used in a while.\nSo, here are the key takeaways. The OnePlus Open is a fantastic foldable phone. If you’ve been on the fence regarding the durability aspect, this one survived a near-reckless in-hand journey.\nI can’t say the same about many phones out there, and certainly not about foldable devices. I am not sure if the upcoming successor will be as good as the OnePlus Open, but if you are eyeing a Christmas treat for yourself, this one won’t disappoint you.\nDon’t worry — this isn’t a Halloween trick; it’s a much-anticipated treat. The OnePlus 13 has been officially announced. While the highly anticipated handset will first launch in China, a global release is sure to follow. The OnePlus 13 will replace the OnePlus 12, which continues to be one of our favorite smartphones of the year.\nAs expected, the OnePlus 13 features a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and offers up to 24GB of RAM for smooth performance even in demanding tasks and games. The phone includes a 6.82-inch 2K 10-bit OLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate to deliver vibrant colors, deep blacks, and smooth motion. Typical brightness for the display is rated at 800 nits, while peak brightness is an impressive 4,500 nits.\nApple’s iPhone 16 has arrived, and it’s quite an impressive offering this year.

Obviously, we would get all of the specs on the phone at launch, but the Chinese telecommunications authority TENAA (similar to the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S.) recently shared an almost complete specs list. Since it's coming from an official agency, this is information that you can pretty much take at face value.\nAccording to the certification, the OnePlus 13 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and will come with a 4.1GHz CPU, and have a 6,000mAh battery.

    "content": "Patent trolls are a growing challenge for the software industry. And the Linux Foundation has launched a large campaign to snuff them out.\nAttendees at the annual cloud-native software developers conference known as Kubecon this week were surprised at the force with which the Linux Foundation highlighted the growing legal and regulatory issues facing the open-source software industry. Legal organizations called non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as patent trolls, have been increasingly targeting open-source software.\nKubecon North America 2024\nThe Linux Foundation and its Cloud Native Computing Foundation division led with the topic of patent trolls and software regulation at the opening keynote on Wednesday here in Salt Lake City and announced the Cloud Native Hero Challenge, which rewards developers for identifying prior art and other evidence to invalidate predatory patents. This follows a recent successful bounty operation by Cloudflare to combat patent trolling.\n“It’s unfortunate [that they have to do something], but looking at the success of CNCF, it is expected,” said Anirban Sengupta, CTO and SVP of Engineering at Aviatrix and former senior director of Google Kubernetes Engine and Anthos. “It is great to see CNCF and Linux foundation have a plan to deal with it”\nAnirban Sengupta, CTO of Aviatrix and a Kubernetes engineer. \nThe risks of patent trolls is especially acute in the cloud industry, where open-source projects such as Kubernetes are becoming part of the fabric of cloud infrastructure. Patent trolling poses a huge threat to businesses. With an estimated 80% of businesses using some form of OSS, a successful patent challenge to an open-source project could threaten the operation of everyday software services and applications.\nLinux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin sent a clear message that an escalation of patent troll activity, in which legal entities patent pieces of open-source code and then launch legal challenges to people using it, is a huge challenge in the software industry.\n“We’ve got to stop it,” Zemlin said in a press conference here at the event.\nThe addition of the Cloud Native Hero Challenge uses a crowdsourcing approach to stop the trolls. This follows other recent efforts. In September, the CNCF announced a partnerhip with Unified Patents to raise resources to fight the legal challenges.\nZemlin said that if the open-source community can make life difficult for the patent trolls, they’ll go elsewhere where there is less resistance.\nIn addition to the patent-troll threat, Zemlin said the Linux Foundation and other open-source organizations are seeing increased legal and regulatory burdens.\n“The big moving pieces are legal changes, regulatory challenges, and cybersecurity challenges,” said Zemlin. “What do we do to deal with the trifecta of challenges? We work on the challenges collectively.”\nSome of the examples cited by Zemlin include patent trolling as well as ongoing legal activities such as federal subpoenas, AI legislation, and cease-and-desist orders.\n\"This is a significant increase in activity,” Zemlin said about the Linux Foundation’s legal and regulatory challenges. “Open source is becoming a more regulated part of the world. That's probably not a horrible thing. But the days of minimal oversight are retiring.\"\nIn the ongoing battle over the fork of the open-source Terraform code, which involves HashiCorp and the open-source project OpenTofu, both sides have been occupying the CNCF’s time with legal salvos. HashiCorp in particular has been sending cease-and-desist orders over code being used in OpenTofu.\n“We support the right to fork,” said Zemlin. “In this case what matters is adhering to strict intellectual property rules.”\nAlex Williams, founder and publisher of the New Stack, a publication that covers open-source and DevOps themes, said the issues brought up by the Linux Foundation reflect the increased regulatory and security demands of software, especially in the open-source community.\n“I was surprised [by the force of the message], but leading technologists have been warning us about this for several years,” Williams told me. “You are seeing the coming regulation of software, the government being more forceful doing things such as eliminating C and C++ [code]. There is a security angle.”\nBy teaming with Unified Patents, the CNCF and Linux Foundation believe they can have an impact. Unified Patents collects data that shows that NPE patent challenges have been increasing in general but have backed off a bit in the last couple of years. For example, in 2015 there were just 32 NPE patent infringement claims against cloud-native OSS projects. That number rose to a high of 198 in 2021. The numbers did drop to 162 in 2022 and 126 in 2023.\nHowever, those numbers by no means show the problem has abated. And with the increased use of OSS in major software projects including AI, the patent challenges present a threat to some of the largest businesses in the world, which are using OSS. For example, Kubernetes, a major OSS effort in compute, is used by most AI applications.\nWith all these challenges coming to the fore, the message here at Kubecon has been clear: The OSS community will be escalating its fight to protect code\n\nOne Community.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        In Salt Lake City richtet die Cloud Native Computing Foundation derzeit die nordamerikanische Ausgabe der Konferenz KubeCon + CloudNativeCon aus. \n      \n\n      (Bild: Cloud Native Computing Foundation)\n    \nDie Hausmesse der Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), die KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, gibt es inzwischen in vier Varianten. Die eine ist die europäische Version, deren jüngste Ausgabe im März in Paris stattfand – heise berichtete. Nächstes Mal wird sie Anfang April 2025 in London stattfinden. Es gibt eine für den chinesischen und asiatischen Markt zugeschnittene Version und inzwischen auch eine für den indischen Subkontinent. Derzeit findet die nordamerikanische Version der Konferenz statt. Über 9000 Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer haben sich dieses Jahr auf den Weg nach Salt Lake City, Hauptstadt des US-Bundesstaates Utah, gemacht. Vom 12. bis 15. November ist dort das Zentrum von Cloud-native und Kubernetes. Das überspannende Thema ist \"Scaling to new heights\" – Aufbruch zu neuen Höhen.\nIn der Eröffnungsrede lag der Fokus aber zunächst bei quelloffener Software generell und dessen Schutz. heise hat im Rahmen des Open Source Summit EU im September 2024 vom neuen Vorgehen der Linux Foundation gegen die sogenannten Patenttrolle berichtet. Nun ruft die CNCF – wie damals angekündigt – die Community zur Mithilfe auf. In der Cloud Native Heroes Challenge können alle Interessierten ihr Scherflein beitragen. Konkret bedeutet das: die Zuweisung eines Patents, das der Teilnehmer oder die Teilnehmerin hinsichtlich seiner tatsächlichen Gültigkeit prüfen soll. Dazu gibt es Videoanleitungen und Hinweise zum Vorgehen. Natürlich gibt es auch etwas zu gewinnen: bis zu 3000 US-Dollar. Alle Teilnehmenden erhalten entweder ein T-Shirt oder eine Wasserflasche mit der Aufschrift \"Cloud Native Heroes\".\nAnschließend ging es aber wieder um Kubernetes und Co. Primär gab es Neuigkeiten aus der Projektecke. Dapr und cert-manager haben nun einen neuen Reifegrad erreicht und dürfen sich \"graduiert\" nennen. Dafür müssen sie eine ganze Reihe von Anforderungen erfüllen. Zurzeit sind es 15. Dazu gehören unter anderem Dokumentation, Projektorganisation an sich und eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit des Überlebens. cert-manager dient zur Verwaltung von X.509-Zertifikaten für die verschlüsselte Kommunikation in der Cloud-native-Welt. Dapr ist eine Laufzeitumgebung für verteilte Applikationen. Dazu stellt es APIs für die notwendigen Funktionen wie beispielsweise Nachrichtenaustausch, Arbeitsabläufe, Verwalten von Passwörtern oder kryptografischen Operationen bereit.\nIm Bereich Observability und Telemetrie findet schon seit einiger Zeit eine Konsolidierung statt. Die CNCF hat inzwischen alleine vier Projekte auf das Abstellgleis geschoben. In offizieller Sprache heißt das übrigens \"archiviert\". Dazu passt auch die Ankündigung der Jaeger-Version 2.0.0. Diese neue Hauptversion ist einerseits eine natürliche Entwicklung. Genaugenommen ist sie identisch zur Version 1.63.0. Eine wesentliche Neuerung ist andererseits aber die Verwendung des sogenannten Open Telemetry Collector als Basis für die Jaeger-Komponenten. Laut Eigenaussage haben die entsprechenden Projekte schon in der Vergangenheit immer wieder den gleichen Quelltext benutzt beziehungsweise ausgetauscht. Diese \"Doppelart\" fällt nun weg. Gleichzeitig reflektiert dieser Schritt auch, dass sich OpenTelemetry als De-facto-Standard zum Einsammeln und Bereitstellen von Telemetriedaten etabliert hat.\n\n      \n        \n\n      (Bild: Screenshot (Udo Seidel))\n    \nDen Abschluss bildet eine Version von Keycloak. Noch ein De-facto-Standard: diesmal im Bereich quelloffene Software für IAM (Identity and Access Management). Keycloak kommt hier oft als Identity Provider zum Einsatz und ermöglicht unter anderem Single Sign-on, fein granulierte Autorisierungen und starke Authentisierung. In Version 26 sind folgende Neuerungen interessant: Es lassen sich die X.509-Serverzertifkate ohne Neustart austauschen und die Daten über die angemeldeten Benutzer landen nun einer Datenbank. Damit sind sie auch nach einem Neustart noch zugreifbar und Keycloak benötigt weniger Arbeitsspeicher zur Laufzeit. Darüber hinaus gibt es eine technische Vorschau zur Integration mit OpenTelemetry.\nKorrektur in Bezug auf die Konferenzgröße\n\n\n\n(mai)\n\n\n\n    montags und donnerstags - alles von heise developer\n  \n\n    Ausführliche Informationen zum Versandverfahren und zu Ihren\n    Widerrufsmöglichkeiten erhalten Sie in unserer\n    Datenschutzerklärung.\n  \n\n        Immer informiert bleiben: Klicken Sie auf das Plus-Symbol an einem Thema, um diesem zu folgen.

    "content": "OCSF, an open-source approach to tackling cybersecurity data challenges, is now backed by the Linux ... [+] Foundation.\nThe Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework has joined the Linux Foundation as one of its projects, marking an important step for the cybersecurity community. This move aims to support OCSF's mission of developing an open, extensible standard to tackle persistent issues of data normalization and interoperability in the industry.\nInitially co-founded by AWS and Splunk, OCSF has seen considerable growth since its inception in 2022, and joining the Linux Foundation is intended to further support this progress by providing additional resources and a broader platform. This development follows the initial launch of OCSF in 2022 and the one-year anniversary of OCSF's progress in 2023.\nOCSF began as a collaboration between AWS and Splunk to address the challenges associated with sharing, standardizing, and acting on cybersecurity data across organizations. The framework aims to solve the lack of a common language for security events and data, a challenge that has often hindered effective collaboration in the industry. Since its launch, OCSF has grown from 18 founding members to over 900 contributors, including organizations from government, independent software vendors, and enterprises. This growth illustrates the widespread recognition of the need for a unified approach to data normalization and interoperability.\nJoining the Linux Foundation provides OCSF with additional resources, greater visibility, and a more structured approach to governance. The Linux Foundation's experience in fostering open-source projects and guiding them to industry adoption makes it a logical partner for OCSF as it seeks to expand. With this partnership, OCSF aims to further its role in establishing a global standard for cybersecurity data.\nSince its launch, OCSF has addressed some key challenges in the cybersecurity sector. By introducing a unified schema, OCSF has helped reduce the complexity of data normalization, a major challenge for the industry.\nThis initiative has led to more efficient threat detection and response, improved interoperability between various security tools, and enabled more effective data sharing. Organizations such as CVS Health and MGM Resorts International have reported improvements from adopting OCSF, including better integration of security data and enhanced communication among cybersecurity teams. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has also contributed to improving OCSF's compatibility with different security platforms, helping to expand its application across the industry.\nThe Linux Foundation's support is expected to help OCSF grow by providing access to a broader community, enhanced documentation, workshops, and improved contributor engagement. The partnership is intended to facilitate greater collaboration across sectors, fostering innovation and ensuring that OCSF can adapt to meet the evolving needs of the cybersecurity landscape. The Linux Foundation's established infrastructure for supporting open-source projects could help attract new contributors and further strengthen the OCSF framework.\nOCSF's value lies in its ability to bring together security practitioners, data producers, and engineers. The vendor-agnostic nature of the framework promotes interoperability, allowing different security tools to integrate more effectively, which in turn can enhance threat detection and response. Looking ahead, there is potential for integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning with OCSF to improve threat detection, which could further enhance its utility in the cybersecurity field.\nIn the short term, the Linux Foundation's backing will likely accelerate OCSF's ability to support modeling more types of event data and artifacts, providing security practitioners with more versatile tools. Over the longer term, OCSF aims to expand its framework capabilities to cover additional cybersecurity domains and to become an industry standard for security telemetry. Upcoming milestones include the release of expanded observable types, improved documentation, and a shared corpus of mapping examples to streamline implementation for new adopters.\nI had a chance to speak with a couple people about OCSF's future under the Linux Foundation.\nMark Terenzoni, Director of Risk Management at AWS, commented: \"The decision to bring OCSF under the Linux Foundation’s umbrella is a natural and exciting progression. The Linux Foundation’s expertise in nurturing open source projects and its neutral governance model will provide OCSF with the ideal platform to accelerate adoption and development.\"\nPaul Agbabian, Vice President of Security Technology Leadership at Splunk, added: \"Collaborating with The Linux Foundation furthers the credibility of OCSF's mission and provides new resources. This transition will enable OCSF to reach additional contributors from more disciplines, expanding the breadth and depth of the core schema to become even more relevant.\"\nOCSF's integration with the Linux Foundation represents a notable development in cybersecurity collaboration. The project aims to continue improving interoperability and resilience across the cybersecurity ecosystem, which is essential as threats evolve. The support from the Linux Foundation could make OCSF a key player in enhancing how security vendors, enterprises, and government entities collaborate. By striving for a common language for cybersecurity data, OCSF hopes to foster a more connected approach to defending against cyber threats.\n\nOne Community.

    "content": "Any retro-loving gamer knows it’s next to impossible to legally play most titles from the past 50 years of gaming history. This is where game emulation—essentially recreations of an old console’s hardware environment in software form—come into play. These open-source programs are some of the best and, for some, the only way to play the greatest titles of yesteryear. As easy as these emulators make the process for players, developers spend years finetuning their software, always all under the ire of game publishers who would prefer these software recreations not exist at all.\nSo, how do they work? Independent developers described it like you would a physical machine. Imagine you had a clock, every gear synced in perfect time. An emulator of that clock would take each output of the clock, every gear spinning, every switch flipped, and every clock hand ticked, and translate that into code.\nRiley Testut, the main face behind the Delta emulator on iOS, chatted with Gizmodo about the rigors of development. Work on Delta is ongoing. Testut launched the first beta to bring online multiplayer to the Nintendo DS emulator earlier this month. It’s an exciting time for him and many others to test the limits of emulation on PC, handhelds, and even VR headsets. Still, he told us it took him close to five years to reach this point. Developing the base code of the emulator took relatively little time. Instead, the spit and polish required to make it playable required most of his and fellow developers’ effort.\nHe described the emulation process as akin to any video or image app. The data is just that—bits of code that need interpretation. An emulator takes ROMs (read-only memory), old games copied directly from old cartridges or discs, and then replicates the environment to play them.\n  \n\n\n“In my head, a ROM is just a JPG,” Testut said, relating these read-only files to digital image formats. “It’s just a piece of data, and then you have a picture viewer that reads the data and displays it. An emulator takes a piece of data and then just knows how to interpret that specific data into visual and audio.”\nLongtime emulation creator Benjamin Stark, AKA Zodttd, most recently developed the Gamma emulator to play PS1 on iOS. He told Gizmodo over email that he likened emulation to a conversation between two machines.\n“Imagine someone who couldn’t make it to a wedding party where they need to give a speech,” he said. “This person doesn’t speak the same language as the rest of the party. An emulator can be seen as an app that creates an AI avatar exactly like them. Their avatar socializes at the party, with everything said translated back and forth. Finally, their avatar reads a translated speech to everyone, as if the person were standing there.”\nThat’s the simple version, but it belies an incredibly complex web of scenarios that arise from translating hardware into a software environment. Emulating the relatively simple Game Boy is far less complicated than the PlayStation 2. The simplest form of this hardware-to-software is a kind of “interpretation,” when the emulation pretends to be a physical system. This would happen at “runtime” while the software operates. It’s more intensive, but it works fine for older systems like old Ataris or the NES running on something as powerful as a modern PC.\nEmulators often get combined into packages for ease of use, as you might see on devices like the Miyoo Mini. For more modern devices, many users prefer the Steam Deck for emulation, and the reason for that is Emudeck. The person behind Emudeck, who goes by DragoonDorise online, isn’t an emulation developer per se, but he has a lot of experience getting these emulators to work on a unique system, that being the Linux-based SteamOS.\n“Not all systems are designed the same at the hardware level,” Dragoondorise told Gizmodo over Discord. Something like the Sega Saturn is especially hard to emulate because of its number of processors. An emulator “has to mimic every one of those processors and the way they integrate and sync with one another. Black Magic.”\nAnd then you get into the issues with peripherals. Stark said he had to do a lot of design to make the PlayStation’s first DualShock controller fit onto a touchscreen device. He said an emulator consists of a front-end alongside what he calls the “emulation core,” which displays all the game’s visuals, sound, and menus. The user only interacts with the front-end, and the difficulty is getting it as seamless as possible.\nFor something with 3D graphics, it gets far more complicated. A Gamecube emulator like Dolphin isn’t just pretending to be Nintendo’s famed, and often overlooked console with a handlebar, it’s “recompiling the ROM on the fly into a native executable,” Testut said. That’s something your average PC has a lot easier time running than if it were trying to do it at runtime. The difficulty could be getting a modern device to comprehend the 3D graphics. Stark said that, on mobile, developers commonly use programs like OpenGL, Metal, or Vulkan to write 3D graphics for these systems. Depending on the platform, you may be developing more for one than another.\n“You have a whole embedded compiler that’s constantly compiling code and making it look good, and the performance improvement is drastic,” the Delta developer said. “That’s a huge step up in complexity, but that’s what gets to the modern systems today.”\nSome consoles are harder to emulate than others. Most notoriously, emulated games for the Nintendo 64 may show broken textures or effects that ruin the experience. That’s why there’s a burgeoning world of FPGA emulation, which is essentially a form of hardware replication that can play old games in their original format.\nWhile it offers verisimilitude to the original console experience, FPGA is often a far more expensive option for most consumers, which is why software emulation still reigns supreme. According to Testut, there may be several hundred emulation developers with big enough names to have a following. Stark said some developers will develop the “core” of the emulation, allowing others to build off it and create the front-end. Beyond that, thousands more independent actors are likely offering time and code for these individual projects. DragoonDorise related it to a FOSS—a Free and Open Source Software—development “utopia.”\nThere are a few legends in emulation development. Stark mentioned the developer Exophase, who created multiple emulation cores and front-ends, such as the GameBoy Advance emulator goSP. He contributed to that project and helped bring it to the iPhone long before Apple started allowing emulators on iOS.\nIt’s easy to underestimate how big emulation is online. However, if you peek at the Emulation Wiki, you’ll find lists of emulators for every console under the sun, even those in a niche such as Mattel’s Intellivision or Nokia’s N-Gage. Then, there’s the huge and growing homebrew scene. These are developers making games for these old consoles, selling the ROMs, and even manufacturing cartridges capable of being played on emulators, original consoles, or an FPGA device. For some examples, look to Goodboy Galaxy for the Game Boy or Alwa’s Awakening for the NES.\nEven though they may detest the idea of ROMs, relating it to piracy, modern publishers rely on emulation. Current-day retro-focused companies like Digital Eclipse make their living by creating “interactive documentaries” of past games. The company effectively builds emulations of those games by looking at and recreating the game’s actual ROM. Xbox confirms on its support page it uses emulation for all the titles from Xbox 360 and the original Xbox you can play on Game Pass. The only difference between these companies and an open-source emulation is the developers and publishers own or pay for the rights to these titles.\nThose lucky games that get official emulator release are the exception, not the rule. In some cases, older games are caught up in license hell. A game made in the ’70s, ’80s, or ’90s might have an ownership split between the original developers or defunct companies, and few modern companies want that headache of deciphering that mess for the sake of rereleasing an old game. Take, for example, Goldeneye 007, whose rights were split between Xbox, Nintendo, Rare, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Eon Productions, and Danjaq LLC. That game only got a rerelease in 2023, despite its enduring popularity.\nThe passion, instead, comes from those who originally played these games. The industry is full of developers who got started by emulating or enhancing older titles. Seth Fulkerson, a designer at the indie studio Limited Run Games, cut his teeth by remastering the infamous CD-i Nintendo-licensed games Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. Last year, Fulkerson and his studio released Arzette: the Jewel of Faramore, a game heavily inspired by those 1993 titles, even including the awkward, computer-made animations.\nWhen I recently met up with Rob Dunlavey – the illustrator who did backgrounds for the Zelda CD-i games \u0026 Arzette –  he gave me an incredibly heartfelt gift…the original world map sketches for both games. I'm so happy and unbelievably grateful. pic.twitter.com/vrvRTCxab1\n— Seth Fulkerson (@thedopster) April 3, 2024\n\nSimply put, the games industry is inherently tied to emulation, not just for the sake of older games or re-releases but also for new titles. The issue is that there’s still no legal precedent to speak to the legality of emulation in all its many contexts. Inevitably, that’s bound to cause issues.\nMany of the largest publishers and console makers have demonized emulation for years. Distribution platforms like Nintendo Online, Xbox Game Pass, or PlayStation Store all offer mere licenses to games and never the games themselves. What should happen when those online stores go defunct, like what happened with the Wii U, 3DS, and Xbox Live marketplaces? You won’t be able to buy those games again until those owners re-release them later, if they ever do.\nOne of the earliest examples of emulation, Connectix’s Video Game Station, which allowed users to play PlayStation games on Mac back in 1999, managed to fight off a lawsuit from Sony. The game company eventually bought VGS, just to make sure it could shut it down. Despite this early legal win, game companies—especially Nintendo—have long-held enmity for emulation.\nLast year, Nintendo blocked Gamecube and Wii emulator Dolphin from coming to Steam. There was a lot of initial consternation on Nintendo’s part over the development team using a Wii Common Key to get around the console’s inherent encryption. After talking to an attorney, the Dolphin developers wrote that they wanted to clarify: “Dolphin is not primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection” but is solely designed to recreate the Gamecube and Wii as software. They argued that “only an incredibly tiny portion” of the code was used to get around encryption. Plus, developers pointed out Dolphin is capable of playing homebrews as well.\nDerek Bambauer, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law and an intellectual property expert, told Gizmodo in a phone interview that the encryption key cited by Nintendo likely wasn’t enough to claim copyright under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. As long as the developers aren’t hacking the system to any “clean room” extent, then they have a better chance of arguing in court that their emulator isn’t designed to facilitate piracy. Dolphin previously said all it took to extract the key was “some smart engineers and a pair of tweezers.”\n“They have written a different set of source code that can accomplish the same set as functions that Nintendo or some other console does,” Bambauer said. “I think it would be very tricky to argue that it’s copyrightable because all they copied is the higher level stuff.”\nSince the start of 2024, there has been blood in the water drawn out from emulators, and Nintendo is the biggest shark prowling these depths. In March, James games company managed to shut down the Yuzu Switch emulator after it filed a lawsuit against its developers. The developers also agreed to pay $2.4 million for the settlement. In the following months, the owners of the Mario franchise then went after many other mirrors of Yuzu and other Switch emulators like Pineapple. On Oct. 1, Nintendo pressured the developers of the Switch emulator Ryujinx to shut down operations.\nJonathan Loiterman, an attorney with the Foundation Law Group who focuses on gaming and digital media, told Gizmodo over the phone that companies like Nintendo could target emulators if they wanted to. Even the threat of a protracted court battle is enough to make a small-fry independent emulation developer drop their work, as was the case with Yuzu and other Switch emulation developers. In other cases, with emulators of past consoles, it’s simply not worth Nintendo’s time to do so, not to mention the community backlash it may cause.\n“Nintendo has deep pockets, they have the money to do it,” Loiterman said. “Instead, they are enforcing what are reasonable boundaries for what is OK. [Nintendo doesn’t] have a commercial opportunity in the Gamecube today in the way they do for the Switch.”\nEven showing emulation working online can put you in Nintendo’s crosshairs. Russ Crandell, who runs the excellent Retro Game Corps YouTube channel, is one more DMCA strike away from seeing the streaming site take down his channel. He said Nintendo targeted videos of him playing a Switch emulator and even another video showing Wii U emulation working well on Android. He told The Verge that several of those videos show he physically owns the games he’s emulating on camera.\nWhile most console emulator developers might feel safe for now, that doesn’t mean companies’ priorities won’t change in the future. Beyond that, ROMs are a potential legal minefield. Companies could go after ROM distributors like movie and music companies did in the 2000s against piracy. That hasn’t happened to any significant degree. Loiterman said Nintendo could legally try to “expunge the Earth of all the NES emulators out there,” but that may not actually help the company’s long-term goals.\nIn Yuzu’s case, Nintendo went after those developers over “facilitating this community of people who were exchanging ROMs,” Loiterman said. Still, as both Loiterman and Bambauer pointed out, Nintendo’s case was focused on how Yuzu worked to defy a technological measure meant to keep copyright safe, something that’s restricted in Code 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Practically all major modern consoles have encryption built into the system, something emulators must somehow bypass to recreate the hardware as software.\nDesigners aren’t too worried about their legal future. Stark and Testut pointed out that Yuzu had to bypass a lot of encryption on the Switch.\n“The emulation community is the core market of video game companies, centered around nostalgia,” Stark said. “Emulation is seen as an act of love by the community for these companies.”\nBeyond all that, users should feel safe downloading an emulator. These hardware-to-software environments are fair game so long as they don’t contain any ROMs themselves. However, the games themselves, those ROMs, are direct copies of the original games. They are breaking copyright, and it is certainly illegal to distribute. That means any system that comes with pirated ROMs preinstalled is similarly illegal. Emulation developers are better off trying to ensure they promote how their emulators can also play homebrews and non-pirated content, according to Bambauer. It’s not close to a full legal shield, but it establishes these programs exist for uses beyond piracy.\nBooks fall apart. VHS tapes eventually degrade. DVDs will scratch and die, but our society has done a much better job at preserving movies and literature than we have with gaming. Part of that is how games are tied to their original format and individual consoles. Video game preservationists have cited emulation as one of the few ways our society has been able to preserve the art form. That’s important because a Video Game History Foundation study found that 87% of games from before 2010 are not commercially available anywhere.\nIn 2019, former games journalist Frank Cifaldi—now the founder and co-director of the VGHF—said during the annual Games Developer Conference that the state of video game preservation is “dire.” To maintain access to out-of-print games, he said emulation is “the best tool for keeping older games in print in a cost-effective and accurate way.”\n \nIn 2018, Sony released the PlayStation Classic console that used the PCSX emulator in its hardware. The console didn’t sell as well as it should have, mostly due to UI issues, but it was one of the first times major publishers recognized the benefits of emulation. Though Atari has released backward-compatible consoles for the 2600 and 7800, few major game makers have gone the same route. Though few publishers want to give emulators tacit approval and sell their old ROMs for a profit, they seem to use emulation internally. Recently, one fan at the Nintendo Museum in Japan heard a chime when they disconnected a controller playing the SNES. That sound indicated the machine was likely running Windows, which would point to the game running on an emulator.\n@BobWulff pic.twitter.com/6HjWqN4DRH\n— Chris (@ChrisMack32) October 14, 2024\n\nThe video game industry refuses to acknowledge the potential of emulation. In October, the U.S. Copyright Office sided with industry groups representing the games industry against preservationists. The office decided to continue enforcing rules restricting video game museums and libraries from allowing people to access defunct games online remotely. Part of the Copyright Office’s register’s issue was over the concept of “emulation as a service” that was put forward by preservationists. The office’s director, Shira Perlmutter, wrote that emulation “would implicate copyright owners’ distribution rights.”\nIn response, the VGHF wrote the decision “forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable.” If you want to research and analyze many old, defunct games, you have no choice but to download ROMs.\nTestut said he hopes that there may come a day when emulators are seen as far more legitimate. Companies may sell consumers the ROMs of their old games for a few bucks a pop, then let them play however and wherever they want. That seems like a pipe dream for the vertically integrated publishers and console manufacturers, but one can dream.\nThe fact that emulators have to exist points to an existential failure of the games industry to preserve its most beloved titles. Emulator developers spend years creating and perfecting their software. Some emulators are slightly janky to use, but others, like Delta, Dolphin, or PS1 emulator Gamma, make the process of playing relatively seamless. The community is strong and growing all the time. As much as the license holders say they’re trying to expand the classics market, they’ve obviously failed to meet demand.\nThere is still no official English translation of the classic RPG Mother 3, but there are enduring fan translations that have become the defacto way to play the game in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even when you ignore the classics, emulation still makes a case against companies that try to exploit customers. There is demand for Super Mario Sunshine for the Gamecube. In all its wisdom, Nintendo released a special version of past 3D Mario games in Super Mario 3D All-Stars, but in a limited run that now costs an obscene $140 on Amazon. Should the legacy Japanese game maker truly be surprised if more consumers turn to emulation, especially to experience these games as close to how the studio originally intended?\n“Emotionally, [emulation is] a way of going back to the golden age of video games,” DragoonDorise said. “Morally, it’s the only way to make sure those video games are not lost to time.”\n\n    EmulationGamingNintendo  \n\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\n        \n\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\n        \n\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\n    \n\n          Delight your friends and family with some awesome gadgets this holiday season.\n        \n\n          The first expansion to Universal's Mario Park will open in Japan December 11.\n        \n\n          That comes out to about 3 hours of usage per day.\n        \n\n          While the Switch 2 may be backwards compatible, Nintendo would not confirm whether we'll still be able to use our old cartridges.\n        \n\n          The company also recently shuttered a studio developing a AAA multiplatform game.\n        \n\n          Hardware hackers prove they can make the Nintendo Alarmo play whatever they want on screen without ripping out its guts.\n        \n\nThe Best Tech Gifts of 2024 ➜\nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

They are already used by a broad community of developers, researchers, and government bodies worldwide. Today, Meta announced that it is making Llama available to U.S. government agencies, including those working on defense and national security applications, and external contractors supporting their defense and national security work.\nMeta has partnered with several companies, including Accenture Federal Services, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, and Snowflake, to bring Llama to U.S. government agencies in various ways.\nFor example, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure will host Llama models for government agencies on their secure cloud solutions designed for sensitive data. Similarly, IBM's watsonx is bringing Llama to national security agencies in their self-managed data centers and clouds.\nMeta claims that the ethical use of open-source AI models like Llama will support the prosperity and security of the United States and help establish U.S. open-source standards in the global race for AI leadership. Meta mentioned that large language models like Llama could streamline complicated logistics and planning, track terrorist financing, strengthen cyber defenses, and more within government agencies.\nMeta also highlighted the need for open-source language models as the U.S. government considers restricting open-source AI. Meta's argument is that existing open-source systems have helped the U.S. government accelerate defense research and high-end computing, identify security vulnerabilities, and improve communication between disparate systems. Meta mentioned that China and other U.S. competitors are racing to develop their own open-source models, investing heavily to leap ahead of the U.S.\nNick Clegg, President of Global Affairs at Meta, wrote the following in a blog post announcing Llama's availability for government agencies:\n\"We believe it is in both America and the wider democratic world's interest for American open-source models to excel and succeed over models from China and elsewhere. As open-source models become more capable and more widely adopted, a global open-source standard for AI models is likely to emerge, as it has with technologies like Linux and Android. This will happen whether the United States engages or not. This standard will form the foundation for AI development around the world and become embedded in technology, infrastructure and manufacturing, and global finance and e-commerce.\"\nBy promoting open source AI, Meta aims to foster collaboration and innovation while ensuring the U.S. remains at the forefront of AI development on the global stage. This initiative could potentially shape the future of AI and its role in government and defense.\n\n                    \n                                                    Aditya Tiwari\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Nov 1, 2024\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            0\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Pradeep Viswanathan\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Sep 26, 2024\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            0\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Pradeep Viswanathan\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Jul 23, 2024\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            6\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Paul Hill\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Feb 24, 2023\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            5\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\n\n                                cuktech s15 se\n                                \n\n                                terramaster f4-424 max\n                                \n\n                                unifydrive\n                                \n\n                                silent hill 2\n                                \n\n                                manba one\n                                \n\n                        windows 11 24h2\n                        \n\n                        windows 11 24h2 unsupported\n                        \n\n                        hard drive\n                        \n\n                        windows insider\n                        \n\n                                    © Since 2000 Neowin®\n                                    All trademarks mentioned are the property of their respective owners.\n                                \n",

Upton lernte als Schüler an einem BBC Micro programmieren und studierte nach einem Bachelor in Physik und Ingenieurwissenschaften an der Cambridge University Informatik. Als Director of Studies für das Fach Informatik am St. John's College in Cambridge war er zuständig für die Zulassung von Studenten. In dieser Zeit stellte er fest, dass sich immer weniger Schulabsolventen für ein Informatikstudium bewarben.

    "content": "Plus: A Look At The Forbes CIO Next 2024 Honorees, DOJ Wants Google To Sell Chrome, Nvidia Smashes Wall Street’s Expectations—But Not Investors’, OCSF Joins Linux Foundation\nYesterday, I attended the Forbes CIO Summit in New York City. It was a great opportunity to meet tech leaders from around the country, discuss some of the issues facing CIOs now and in the future, and get new perspectives on the challenges CIOs see.\nI spent part of the day moderating two panel discussions on topics I find myself writing about week after week—cybersecurity and making data useful for AI—but I also sat in the audience to listen in on the other discussions. One of my favorite moments was during an open forum about adoption of digital tools moderated by my colleague Alex Konrad and featuring panelists Land O’Lakes CTO Teddy Bekele, SolarWinds CISO Tim Brown, and cofounder and managing partner of FPV Ventures Pegah Ebrahimi. The question was about how widespread adoption of AI was impacting what the CIO’s role in a company would be. Bluntly, whether CIO now stood for “chief innovation officer” or “career is over.”\nEbrahimi responded that it actually could be the latter, depending on what a CIO is doing in their role. “As a CIO, you need to be talking to all the business leaders,” she said. “You need to at least have some agenda in the boardroom to say, ‘Okay, on the product we’re doing this, but here’s how we’re enabling on the technology side.’ I think you have to think of yourself as more of a technology leader that is thinking in business ways. And to do that it means having much more relationships on that front.”\nBrown added that the CIO’s job has been one directing transitions for the last several years. Before the transition to AI, CIOs were leading the transition to the cloud—and many are still working on that one, he added. Today’s successful CIO needs to be not just enabling tech transitions, but embracing them. “The change brings a lot of opportunity, and those opportunities are generally not necessarily driven by the business. They’re driven by the technologies that make things possible,” he said.\nBekele agreed with his fellow panelists. “We’re driving the change. We’re bringing the technology, and that’s what’s going to empower either existing business models or new business models,” he said.\nThat empowerment demonstrates both why the CIO’s job is interesting, but also why it continues to be vital. Today’s business world runs on technology, and tech professionals who bring their knowledge and knowhow to the table can make bigger changes to the entire enterprise than most executives.\nWe’ll be taking a break from publishing Forbes CIO next week for the Thanksgiving holiday, and back in your inboxes on December 5.\nPhoto Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nThe federal government asked a judge to force Google to sell its Chrome browser and change how search works on Android mobile devices. This proposed judgment follows the August ruling that Google has maintained an illegal monopoly on search. The Justice Department wants Google to be barred from entering the web browser market for five years and couldn’t own or invest in any search text-based advertising rival company. Chrome commands roughly two-thirds of the browser market, and government antitrust lawyers argued that its dominance there has illegally forcibly channeled users to Google’s search and other products. Selling Chrome, the government argued in a court filing, would “permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.” The government is not asking that Android be divested at this time, but instead that the mobile phone operating system no longer default to Google Search.\nGoogle responded that forcing it to sell Chrome is “unprecedented government overreach.” In a blog post, Google President for Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker writes that this move would “push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products—even beyond Search—that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.”\nForbes senior contributor Barry Collins writes that this order would be challenging to enforce. Chrome is built on the open source browser engine Chromium, which is also the basis of Microsoft Edge and Vivaldi. (Though, he points out, Google engineers have been the biggest contributors to the Chromium project, which could be disrupted by a Chrome sale.) What Google would essentially be selling is its user base, a huge commodity with few obvious potential buyers.\nWhat ultimately happens is up to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who issued the ruling against Google this summer. He will hold a hearing on the request in April, and expects a final ruling by Labor Day 2025. But the Justice Department’s position may change between now and then, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump is seen as more tech- and business-friendly—but maybe he won’t be when the company involved is Google.\nPhoto Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nA pattern is repeating itself: The market gears up for Nvidia’s earnings, seeing the AI chip company’s stock price soar in anticipation in the days before the report. Then the world’s most valuable company actually reports its earnings, smashing records and expectations for sales, revenues and growth. And then Nvidia’s stock price immediately drops.\nIt happened again after markets closed on Wednesday. Here are the particulars: Nvidia’s quarterly revenues were $35.1 billion, 94% above the same time last year and far ahead of expectations of $33.2 billion. Its revenue estimates for the next quarter are $37.5 billion, above consensus forecasts of $37.09 billion. CFO Collette Kress said there is “staggering” demand for the company’s new Blackwell processing unit. And the stock fell 3% almost immediately.\nThe reason is likely the overwhelming hype around Nvidia’s GPU business. The company creates much of the hardware that all AI platforms depend on. But some investors may have come to expect consistent exponential growth from Nvidia, and even though the company continues to outperform more grounded investors’ expectations, the future growth isn’t quite as high as it has been. “There is a risk here … that Nvidia’s current overearning will begin to come to an end,” William de Gale, lead portfolio manager of BlueBox Asset Management’s global technology fund, told CNBC. “There’s considerable risk in this name at the moment. But it’s exciting.”\nThe volatility continued on Thursday. Soon after markets opened, Nvidia’s stock rose to an all-time high of $152.89, but then swooped back down, quickly showing an 8% drop from the high, and recording a net decline of more than 1% by midday.\ngetty\nThe Open Cybersecurity Schema Foundation joined the Linux Foundation earlier this week, aiming to drive more open and accessible cybersecurity plans across industries. Forbes senior contributor Tony Bradley writes that the Linux Foundation’s long history of fostering open source projects, development and adoption makes it an ideal partner for the OCSF. The cybersecurity foundation was cofounded by AWS and Splunk in 2022 to address the challenges of sharing cybersecurity data across different organizations—including devising a common language and data protocols. In two years, the OCSF has grown from 18 founding members to more than 900 collaborators. Joining with the Linux Foundation will help OCSF advance its mission to increase awareness, education and collaboration, as well as better sharing of information on risks and solutions.\nFrom left, Google Cloud CISO Phil Venables, Lockheed Martin CIO Yvonne Hodge, NASA CIO Jeff Seaton.\nWhen companies are thinking about what they want to add in the future, it’s a lot about AI. And as Forbes put together its fifth annual list of the 50 CIOs who are leading the way into the technology of tomorrow, bullish attitudes toward AI adoption were a common feature. The 2024 Forbes CIO Next List, released earlier this week, showcases the best, brightest and most impactful.\nThis year’s honorees include tech leaders from government, and businesses big and small. NASA CIO Jeff Seaton was recognized for his dedication to improving the space exploration agency’s infrastructure. It’s a difficult task, he told Forbes’ Alex Knapp, because of the large amount of data and infrastructure that are under NASA’s purview—including older spacecraft that are millions of miles away from Earth like Voyager, mission data for Mars rovers, the International Space Station and the Artemis project that will return humans to the Moon. NASA has also increased its public-facing web presence, with video streaming, photos and data.\nGoogle Cloud CISO Phil Venables (who will be featured in a Forbes CIO newsletter Q\u0026A next month) was also recognized for his cybersecurity management of one of the largest cloud providers in the world—and by extension, thousands of smaller customers. He told Forbes’ Richard Nieva that his job is not only about security, it’s also about working with customers who are deploying AI. He helped put together Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF), a set of guidelines and best practices for security professionals to safeguard their AI initiatives. Last month, Google launched a free risk assessment tool for companies to evaluate their security situations, which creates a personalized report with potential threats, and suggestions on how to mitigate them.\nOther honorees who have been profiled in Forbes CIO in the last year include Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj and PagerDuty CIO Eric Johnson.\nChip maker AMD announced job cuts last week as it works toward becoming a more dominant player in AI hardware.\n4%: Proportion of employees AMD is cutting, which works out to about 1,000\n18%: Overall year-over-year increase in AMD’s revenue in its most recent quarterly report.

First up was Maksim Panchenko to describe the binary\noptimization and layout tool (BOLT) that Meta uses on its production\nkernels.  It optimizes the kernel binary by rearranging it to improve its\ncode locality for\nbetter performance.  A subsequent article will cover the second talk, which\nlooked at  automatic\nfeedback-directed optimization (AutoFDO) and other related techniques\nthat are used to optimize Google's kernels.\n\n\nPanchenko began with a slide\nshowing a handful of companies and projects that use BOLT, which can be\nseen in his slides\nor the\nYouTube\nvideo of the talk.  It was designed\nat first for large applications at Meta, but it turned out to also\naccelerate compilers.  So, for example, it is used by Python since version 3.12; it is also used by LLVM, Rust, and others.\n\n\nIf you look back to ten years ago in the open-source world, getting the\nmaximum performance  from an application was a\nmatter of using GCC or Clang with -O3, profile-guided\noptimization (PGO), and link-time\noptimization (LTO).  But applying PGO was \"kind of painful\", he\nsaid, so only those who cared a lot about performance were using it.\nApplying PGO to the kernel was even more painful, so most companies just used\n-O2 or -O3 on their kernels.\n\n\nThe main Meta application is a virtual machine running PHP code; around 2015, developers there came up with the idea of a binary optimizer that\nwould work with both GCC and Clang to speed up the generated code.  BOLT\nturned out to exceed developers' expectations;\nit gave large gains and was able to accelerate the compilers themselves.\nIt has been used at Meta since 2016; \"most of the cycles are spent in\nbinaries optimized by BOLT\" throughout the Meta fleet.  BOLT was\nreleased as open source, under the Apache 2.0 license, in 2018 and has been part of LLVM since 2022.\n\n\nGenerally, developers think about how the data structures for their programs will be\narranged in memory; it is less common for them to consider how the code\nis arranged.  There are exceptions, including the Linux kernel developers,\nbut most times the focus is on the data cache.  The instruction cache is\nmuch smaller than the data cache and has not grown much over time,\nmaybe doubling from 32KB to 64KB on Intel CPUs over the last 20 years.\nBut, for large applications that do not spend most of their time in tight\nloops, the layout of code in memory matters a lot, so BOLT can make a major\ndifference, he said.\n\n\nCompilers do not have enough information to optimally place code, even when\nthey have profiling information; it turns out that inlining functions\nchanges the profile.  The profile information may point to a function\nfoo() that is called a lot, but when it is inlined, that\ninformation is not present.  BOLT operates on the binary to observe the\ncode that is being frequently executed so that all of it can be placed\nclose together in memory. Once the BOLT\npaper was released in 2019, he said, other efforts, including\nPropeller, have come about; they are generally tied to a single toolchain,\nthough, while BOLT can be used with GCC or Clang and with different\nlinkers.\n\n\nHe showed a sort of heat map of the memory layout of the HHVM runtime, which is what is used by Meta\nfor most of its workloads.  One image showed hot code spread\nall over, while the post-BOLT image showed all of the hot code\nconfined to the same small region of memory.  That drastically reduces\ninstruction-cache misses, translation-lookaside buffer (TLB) misses, and\nCPU time; for HHVM, BOLT produced a 7% performance increase, Panchenko said.\n\n\nBOLT is a post-link optimizer that runs on ELF binaries, such as\nvmlinux.  Even though it is part of the LLVM project, BOLT still\nsupports GCC code; it also supports the \"most popular\"\narchitectures: x86_64, Arm64, and RISC-V.\n\n\nApplying BOLT to the kernel took some time, mostly in the form of ensuring\nthat the resulting kernel would run and not crash.  One of the big problems\nencountered was in finding a good benchmark to use to measure the impact of\nBOLT.  There are lots of different micro-benchmarks available, but \"I\ncouldn't find any scalable, large-scale benchmark\".  In the end, he\nused the RocksDB\ndb_bench fillseq benchmark, which showed a 2.5% improvement just by\nswitching to a BOLT-optimized kernel.  He and others at Meta ran one\nof the company's main services on a BOLT-optimized kernel that produced a 2% queries-per-second (QPS) improvement, \"which was quite significant\". \n\n\nBOLT only changes branches and the location of the basic blocks in the\nbinary to achieve its improvements.  Most of the time, there is no need to\nrecompile applications in order to apply BOLT; the exception is for\nprograms built with split\nfunctions, which BOLT can do better than the compiler.  The application\ndoes need to be relinked in order to produce relocation information.  With\nthat, and a profile of the kernel running a representative workload, BOLT\nwill only take around four seconds to optimize vmlinux, he said.\n\n\nThe profile can be generated with a variety of mechanisms, including the\nlast branch record (LBR) feature on Intel platforms and similar\nbranch-sampling features on other architectures.  If that is not available,\nthe code can be instrumented to gather the needed information, but that has\nhigher overhead than using LBR and the like.  There are other options, but\nthe profile quality, thus the BOLT optimizations, will not be as good.\n\n\nBOLT needs an unstripped vmlinux binary because it uses the symbol\nnames for code discovery, Panchenko said.  BOLT can easily identify the\nboundaries of code and data in the ELF binary using the text and data\nsegments that are defined.  The segments are further divided into sections\nand BOLT uses the symbol-table information to identify the individual\nfunctions therein.\n\n\nThen BOLT disassembles the functions, though, unlike objdump,\nit will \"symbolize the operands of the instructions\".\nDistinguishing between constants and addresses in the instructions\ncan be a problem, however.  The relocation information that is inserted by the\nlinker helps with that; it can be used to \"effectively do symbolic\ndisassembly\" of the code.  \n\n\nThe resulting instruction stream can be optimized\nusing normal techniques, such as peephole optimization, but \"this is not\nvery efficient\".  In order to do more optimizations on the code, an\nintermediate representation (IR) of some kind is needed. The IR used is\n\"essentially a control-flow graph on top of MC instructions\",\nPanchenko said; he was referring to the LLVM\nmachine code (MC) project, which provides a number of tools and\nlibraries that BOLT uses.  The instructions look much like the assembly\ncode, but some may be annotated or modified to identify tail calls versus\nother kinds of jumps, for example. \"So if you look at BOLT disassembly,\nyou will have a much better idea of what's happening in your application\ncompared to regular objdump\".\n\n\nBOLT uses the profile information for the basic blocks in the control-flow graph\nin order to determine where the hot code resides.  To make the best\ncode-layout decisions, though, having weights on the edges, rather than\njust execution counts for the basic blocks, would be useful.  The LBR\nprofiling can provide that information, but BOLT can recover some\ninformation about edge weights even without it.\n\n\nThen the graph is used to optimize the code; \"The main optimization that \ngives us most of the gains is code reordering.\"  The basic blocks can\nbe grouped together to reduce the instruction-cache footprint of the code.\nThat is done by breaking up the functions into fragments, some of which are\nhot code and others that are rarely or never executed (e.g. error-handling\ncode).  Compilers already do reordering, but on the function level; BOLT\ntakes it one step further and reorders these function fragments.\n\n\nOnce the new code is generated, there is a question about where to put it,\nhe said.  Unless there is a big concern about disk space, it is more efficient to simply create a new text segment that\ncontains the hot code, which will generally be quite a bit smaller (for a\nbinary that is huge, \"hundreds of megabytes\", 20MB or less of hot\ncode would end up in the new segment).  So it is not much overhead, in\nterms of disk space, and \"you get a much faster\napplication\".\n\n\nAdding another\ntext segment to the kernel binary may not be viable, he said, so he turned\nto an alternative that is \"much more feasible\".\nBOLT\nwill simply rewrite the existing functions in the binary; those functions are already\nordered by the compiler based on its analysis, so BOLT effectively uses\nthat.  BOLT could do a bit better function ordering based on the profile, but\nthat small gain can be sacrificed in order to easily get the basic-block\nreordering, he said.  It also helps avoid over-specializing the code for\nonly the workload measured by the profile; for other workloads that were\nnot measured, some of the cold code will be executed, but it will still be\nlocated nearby due to the compiler choices.\n\n\nThe kernel provides other challenges, because its code is modified at boot\ntime and also while it is running.  He spent a good chunk of the talk going\ninto the details of how that type of code is handled.  Things like static\ncalls,\nSMP locks (that are patched out on uniprocessor systems), static keys, and alternative instructions for different\nsubarchitectures are handled with annotations in the disassembled code, which\nis part of the metadata that BOLT uses to do its job.  For some, BOLT\nsimply does not operate on them, while others have mechanisms that the\noptimizer can use on them.  All of that metadata can be dumped using BOLT tools.\n\n\nPanchenko said that he was skipping over some topics, such as continuous\nprofiling, which can be applied to BOLT-optimized binaries as they run;\na new version of a binary can be produced that will reflect changes\nin the code and the workload.

E.g., Zen4 has 32KB I-cache and 32KB D-cache, Zen5 and Raptor Cove have 32KB I-cache and 48KB D-cache, and Gracemont has 64KB I-cache and 32KB D-cache.\n\n\nThe sizes of L1 caches generally have not grown in the last 20 years; e.g., the 2003 Athlon 64 has 64KB I-cache and 64KB D-cache, and the 2003 Pentium M has 32KB I-cache and 32KB D-cache.  Instead, they have added an L3 cache since that time. A number of cores have a microoperation cache in addition to the I-cache, but the sizes are hard to compare.\n\n\n\n      \n          \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 4, 2024 10:45 UTC (Mon)\n                               by paulj (subscriber, #341)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 4, 2024 23:48 UTC (Mon)\n                               by himi (subscriber, #340)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 5, 2024 8:06 UTC (Tue)\n                               by anton (subscriber, #25547)\n                              [Link] (1 responses)\n      \nThe reason for keeping the L1 cache small is latency.  If the cache grows, the miss rate decreases, but the latency increases.  You can see the longer latency nicely in the comparison of L2 sizes and latencies in this article.\n\n\nOne reason is that the wires get longer, which increases the time that signals travel. \n\n\nYou also want to use a virtually-indexed physically-tagged (VIPT) cache as L1 cache, which allows to perform the TLB access and the cache access in parallel, i.e., with low latency.  But that means that the size of a cache way is at most as large as a page; the number of ways is limited (you typically don't see more than 16-way set-associative caches, and a lower number of ways is common in L1 caches), the page size is 4KB on AMD64, which limits the L1 cache sizes to 64KB (and 32KB or 48KB is more common).  Apple's Firestorm (M1 P-core) has larger caches (192KB I-cache, 128KB D-cache), but also 16KB pages, which allows a VIPT cache implementation with a 12-way (I) or 8-way (D) set-associative cache.\n\n\n\n\n      \n          \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 8, 2024 14:42 UTC (Fri)\n                               by raven667 (subscriber, #5198)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n\n            \n            Copyright © 2024, Eklektix, Inc.\n            This article may be redistributed under the terms of the\n              Creative\n              Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license\n            Comments and public postings are copyrighted by their creators.\n            Linux  is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds\n            \n            \n",

The mid-size models, and even the small models, are catching up to frontier models like GPT-4.5o in performance. But the release that blew us all away wasn’t a language model: It was Claude’s computer use API. Computer use allows you to teach Claude how to use a computer: how to run an application, click on buttons, and use a shell or an editor. It has many problems, security not being the least of them—but it’s bound to improve. Sending screen captures to Claude so it can compute where to click is clumsy at best, and there are no doubt better solutions (such as using accessibility tools). However, computer use gives us a glimpse at a future where we’ll be working with agents that can plan and execute complex multistep operations.\n\nJoin the O'Reilly online learning platform.

    "content": "More bad news from Mozilla.\nThe Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Firefox browser maker Mozilla, has laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a “relentless onslaught of change.”\nAnnouncing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the Mozilla Foundation’s executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two of the foundation’s major divisions — advocacy and global programs — are “no longer a part of our structure.”\nThis means Mozilla will no longer be advocating for an open web, privacy, and related ideals, which fits right in with the organisation’s steady decline into an ad-driven effort that also happens to be making a web browser used by, I’m sorry to say, effectively nobody. I just don’t know how many more signs people need to see before realising that the future of Firefox is very much at stake, and that we’re probably only a few years away from losing the only non-big tech browser out there. This should be a much bigger concern than it seems to be to especially the Linux and BSD world, who rely heavily on Firefox, without a valid alternative to shift to once the browser’s no longer compatible with the various open source requirements enforced by Linux distributions and the BSDs.\nWhat this could also signal is that the sword of Damocles dangling above Mozilla’s head is about to come down, and that the people involved know more than we do. Google is effectively bankrolling Mozilla – for about 80% of its revenue – but that deal has come under increasing scrutiny from regulars, and Google itself, too, must be wondering why they’re wasting money supporting a browser nobody’s using.\nWe’re very close to a web ruled by Google and Apple. If that prospect doesn’t utterly terrify you, I honestly wonder what you’re doing here, reading this.\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @[email protected]\nTime for all Mozilla donors to move their donations to the independent options like Ladybird.\nDoes Ladybird Pay for advocacy and global politics teams? If not, then it’s time to move for other browser.\nI just want a browser, I don’t want to know which is the global politics.\nJust give me a good browser, just this, without bullshits.\nAnd now Firefox will pay for developers, not politics.\nAt this point at least, Ladybird pays only for developers.\nThis is nonsense… it just means they are not paying for fluff “advocacy” jobs.\nMozilla has been wasting astronomical amounts of money and putting almost none of it back into the browser.\nActually that advocacy has real world impact. How many banks or other systems block an unsupported browser? Why because no one tells/forces them to. \nFor example, in the UK, advocacy is what gets your browser supported by the government websites.\nhttps://www.gov.uk/help/browser\nIn the EU, there are so many treaties still in effect that force support of IE.. Those are painful to comply with, let me tell you!\nWe are talking about them blowing millions of dollars on that… literaly VERY literally better to spend that money just implementing the required features. Also banks features are usually very basic to begin with. All of this is just blowing money out thier butts instead of putting it towards real improvements.\nIf it has to support IE that means a lowest common denominator exists… so basically nothing to support there because they are required to support something old which is compatible with everyone.\ni am sorry, but real world does not conform to our purely-technical fantasy. you hate it, i also hate it. it is what it is.\n“banks required features” are about guaranteeing that your money does not get stolen by using an insecure web browser. or rather, that the bank is not to blame for it.\nthis is why some banking apps will outright refuse to run on a hacked phone, and it’s perfectly normal that companies will “blow money out of their butt” to have their products recognized for specific use cases. sometimes certified for compliance. being a product backed by a company definitely helps with that.\non paper you might think that you just need to support some js and subset of web standards, but bank may refuse you service if you use an exotic browser – or an outdated one.\nHopefully some politically incorrect people to assume similar roles to pursue browser wars.\nFor me, there is basically Servo and Ladybird.\nI expect Mozilla and FF will be dead on the Linux world within a couple of years. Why do we use FF? Because it’s support for the free Web standards. That’s been dwindling for years now… I expect this news will be the straw that breaks the camels back.\nWe had a whole open future and we threw it away.\nSo much for the interwebs. If there is no way to browse WWW outside the Windows and Mac world then I guess I’ll be doing my surfing on Gemini.\nIt wouldn’t be anything revolutionary when I say it is sad to lose so much of good Netscape-\u003eMozilla heritage and lose  good alternative for commercial giants’ browsers.\nBut if Mozilla/Firefox dies in the end I guess it’s high time to stop fussing and whining and come knocking on Brave’s door.\nI’m still with Firefox, though.\nWith the death of Mozilla it also takes thunderbird with it. Yes, it’s not as high profile, but it’s the only truly viable/modern desktop email client for Linux.\nI wonder if we’ll end up seeing a shift to betterbird or another fork or if we are left with simplified options like Kmail\nWith the death of Mozilla it also takes thunderbird with it. \nThis is a real concern for my company as we are small and can’t afford Enterprise licensing from Microsoft to get full fat Outlook on every workstation. The owner and the operations manager both use their own personal Office 365 accounts so they have access to Outlook, and I have Thunderbird installed on the rest of the workstations that need a reliable and fully functional email client for Windows. \nMy boss (ops manager) has told me in the past that I can move us to Linux workstations once all of the software and hardware we use will work. For software the only holdout is our accounting software; we have been told by the developer that we are one of the last few holdouts who haven’t moved to the cloud hosted version, which oddly enough puts us in the same position as a few extremely large corporations. Our company files are supposedly some of the largest they’ve seen due to using the software since the mid-late 90s, and it would be a nightmare when we have any sort of data corruption if not for the hourly, daily, and weekly backup schedule I keep us on. \nAs for hardware, apart from a couple of warehouse label printers that don’t have Linux drivers we are basically there. All of our workstations are 7th gen Intel or newer, so we can’t run Windows 11 on those oldest ones but we can move to Linux and we will be fine. Once that happens I will most likely go with either OpenSUSE or Fedora KDE. That doesn’t solve the email client problem or web browser problem, but at least it gets us secure and performant workstations.\nMorgan,\nFor software the only holdout is our accounting software; we have been told by the developer that we are one of the last few holdouts who haven’t moved to the cloud hosted version\nOne client is in a similar boat with Quicken. They are being heavily pressured to migrate to a subscription version they don’t want. The boss there doesn’t like the idea of handing over the reigns to such critical business functions.\nOur company files are supposedly some of the largest they’ve seen due to using the software since the mid-late 90s, and it would be a nightmare when we have any sort of data corruption if not for the hourly, daily, and weekly backup schedule I keep us on. \nQuicken is also rather finicky. Surprisingly it doesn’t run on a proper client/server database but uses file shares. Are you by any chance referring to Quicken as well? Haha.\nI don’t like to name names, but yes it’s Quickbooks Enterprise Desktop. It’s an absolute nightmare and they are still trying to figure out how to host our huge company files in their cloud version. We’ve had our accounting firm working on it for the better part of two years now with seemingly no progress.\nAnd yes, their file server situation is antiquated and horrible. The Enterprise Desktop client literally pulls the entire company file (several GBs for one of ours) into local memory across the network, and the server and clients are all juggling changes to the same in-memory file among all open workstations. The more people logged in, the slower it gets for everyone, and it’s also why there are many tasks that require single user mode. You also can’t open the company file across a wireless network or it corrupts the file, hence our wireless only workstations have to VNC into a wired client shoved into a corner of the wiring closet (that was Intuit’s suggestion for handling wireless client access). It’s a major pain in my ass.\nHonestly the cloud hosted version will be better for us once we can get there, but Intuit is telling us our company files are simply too large to host in the cloud and they are working with our accounting firm on a way to do it.\nMorgan,\nAnd yes, their file server situation is antiquated and horrible. The Enterprise Desktop client literally pulls the entire company file (several GBs for one of ours) into local memory across the network, and the server and clients are all juggling changes to the same in-memory file among all open workstations. The more people logged in, the slower it gets for everyone, \nFrom my earliest job decades ago companies have been complaining about that software. I believe the gripes with it are universal. The most surprising thing is how such hated software became so popular in the first place. It seems like intuit should have failed as a company early on, yet they thrived.\nWe have Quickbooks for just 2 people at my company and its STILL our problem child…. terrible update mechanism. \nI hate the idea of moving MS Dynamics into the cloud as well.\nWe got off Quickbooks Enterprise a few years back, from an end user perspective it was horrendous to use, manage and maintain, poor compatibility, unreliable and limited plugins, delays getting patches. Historically it was pushed by accountancy firms, it seems for the larger part to simplify EOFY reporting, the accountants just grab one large flat file and run a script. As soon as the new owners took control they kyboshed Quickbooks almost immediately.\nPersonally, I’m not sure any of the small / medium enterprise solutions are all that great, cloud based or locally hosted they often feel like only 80% of the job was done.\nI feel too many of the smaller solutions are really sole trader packages plus plus, rather than enterprise light.\nFirebox has been my browser of choice for decades but truly it has been a while since I have felt there is much distinction between Firefox and any other “big tech browser”. Mozilla has a very corporate culture at this point. It is reflected in their product and product choices.\nIn my view, what Thom is urging us to protect in Firefox does not really exist anymore. Our best hope at this point for an “independent” browser is Ladybird although Servo is coming along again.\nThat said, both Chromium and Firefox are open source. You can tweak them. You can fork them. You can take out the bits you object to. I am typing this now from the Zen browser which is based on Firefox.\nWe have Blink, WebKit, and Gecko based browsers on Linux. No need to panic just yet. I agree though that the future is increasingly uncertain which is why we need projects like Ladybird to survive and thrive.\nI understand that not everyone are fans of mozilla’s initiatives. But I am afraid of what their failure could mean even for other alternatives. Everyone’s benefited from Mozilla’s advocacy for the open web and standards. Defeating FF might be a watershed moment for corporate browsers using unchecked power to do what they want with no one being able to stand up to them. I get the impression some people don’t realize the lack of open web advocacy makes everyone more vulnerable. Remember google’s web DRM? Next time it could pass. Adblocker users are in the cross hairs right now and face a high risk of being blocked themselves whether running FF or not. If nobody’s left to challenge that, then the new norms brought about by corporate power will effect us all.\nYou don’t need to spend millions of dollars to do that, you need to be publicly relevant. Just like when Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg talk people listen (I am not saying that they don’t spend money in that things). I bet that the money Mozilla spent in the things you mentioned is much less than what it spent in other useless things. Mozilla was successful because Firefox was very relevant back them.\nWithout the alternatives like Firefox, I also see thinks like Manifest v3 just being pushed through. Or choice will be to adopt Edge over Chrome or something like that.\nMozilla’s innovations are part of the what we still have fairly open web.\nBut I guess Google won’t be paying Mozilla anymore and pretty much all of Mozilla’s alternative business ventures failed. Cutting costs will be necessary, their browser market share had fallen too.\nAgreed. Losing a large body that maintains and advances a competing web browser is not good for all the derivatives as well as small competitors.  It will only strengthen the reliance on the mainstream evil.\nLibreWolf and Betterbird lives here.\nThis is the dark side of having the browser being an execution environment for code: The codebase becomes huge, and it takes lots of money to maintain.\nThere is a reason most “independent” browsers are Chrome or Firefox in a trenchcoat with some bells and whistles added. Those “independent” browsers are reliant on a codebase they have no creative control over and largely don’t understand.\nSo, where do we go from here? Frankly, I haven’t got a clue.\nGoogle is effectively bankrolling Mozilla – for about 80% of its revenue – but that deal has come under increasing scrutiny from regulars, and Google itself, too, must be wondering why they’re wasting money supporting a browser nobody’s using.\nI think you meant “regulators”, not “regulars”.\nAlso, Google funding its competition is a strategic move to distract regulators from all the dirty ways they used to make Chrome surpass Firefox (like advertising it on every Google property there is and forcing Android Android OEMs to bundle it with AOSP if they wanted access to the Play Store and Play Services). So, unless the antitrust regulators are involved, Google will keep funding Mozilla even if Firefox’s market share is 0.1%.\nProblem is, antitrust regulators are being involved, and that’s the reason for Mozilla’s panic.\nNow who didn’t see this one coming?\nMight wind up being unnecessary though TBH… I doubt the second Trump DOJ is going to continue with breaking up Google. They’ll probably be busy with juicier targets, like abortion providers and random trans people.\nAfter just a few days of the Trump win and he is not into office yet. The Taliban, The Houthis and Hamas has wound down their war efforts and is now talking about peace and coexistance with the US. China has lowered the amount of bellicose talk against the west and Xi now sounds a lot friendlier to the US and the rest of the west. Even russia seems to be open to peace negotiations now. I have no idea what the end results will be, but if his second term will be as his first, perhaps he truly will be remembered as a “peace president” he is the only president in my lifetime that has not fanned flames of wars and instead ended wars. But who knows, i am not able to see the future.\nI take it you’ve forgotten the entirety of Trump’s first term?\nEdit: nevermind, I see you’re in Sweden, so you are basically unaffected by his domestic policies. Enjoy your nice life in a country that has socialized medicine.\nHow am i not affected by the tax cuts in the US, when i am in europe? For the better i might add. And the biden realignment of the tax code of the trump cuts was negative for everyone but the super rich, i give you that. But the original proposed cuts to taxes changed how much the “regular people” had to pay in taxes to the federal government and sent more of the burden onto corporations and not people. Yes this grants people that also have high income more money (or to keep more of their earned money). There is a taxation curve that most people do not understand. You can tax every person in the entire US 100% and not pay off the national debt, that is why corporations exists in the US. Otherwise it would all be private businesses personally owned by a person and not just a “legal person” like they redefined it during the biden restructure.\nDemocrats was the party of slavery, jim crow, keeping latin america poor through resource extraction and selective immigration. Now they pretend there was this “great switch” just because the south started to vote republican. Newsflash, the south which has majority black states, realized that the democrats was never their friends. \nTo summarize, i would like to end with a quote from democrat president (supposedly elected after the switch) Lyndon B Johnson: “I’ll have those n*****s voting Democratic for the next 200 years”\nWar on povery impoverished the growing black middle class in america and the “projects” did the same as they did in Sweden, lots of drugs and crime.\nYou can never tax a population and corporations more than 17.2% before it becomes detrimental to growth. Some countries decide to tax the poor, like france in the 1700s, the extremely rich as in italy during Saddams regime.\nThe tax imposed can never go above, at least historically if you are to gain growth and prosperity. Biden failed in this regard HEAVILY. And since Kamala did not distance herself from Biden she lost all votes from economically savvy people.\nNaGERST,\nBut the original proposed cuts to taxes changed how much the “regular people” had to pay in taxes to the federal government and sent more of the burden onto corporations and not people. \nDo we live in different universes? That is the opposite of what happened under Trump’s administration…\nhttps://itep.org/corporate-taxes-before-and-after-the-trump-tax-law/\n\n–    America’s largest, consistently profitable corporations saw their effective tax rates fall from an average of 22.0 percent to an average of 12.8 percent after the Trump tax law went into effect in 2018.\n–    The 296 largest and consistently profitable U.S. corporations in this study paid $240 billion less in taxes from 2018 to 2021 than if they had continued to pay the effective rates they’d paid before the Trump tax law.\n–    While profits for the largest, continuously profitable U.S. corporations rose by 44 percent after passage of the Trump tax law, their federal tax bills dropped by 16 percent.\n–    The number of these corporations paying tax rates of less than 10 percent increased from 56 to 95 after the Trump tax law went into effect.\n–    Many of the largest and most well-known corporations in the country — including Walmart, Verizon, Disney, and Meta — had the largest tax reductions after the Trump tax law went into effect.\n\nThere is a taxation curve that most people do not understand. You can tax every person in the entire US 100% and not pay off the national debt, that is why corporations exists in the US.\nTraditional republicans cared about balancing the debt, but all of them are out of the party now. Whether people are in favor of Trump or not, it should be stated that he lead many of his private companies to bankruptcy and he brings that same mindset to the federal government…Debt exploded under trump’s first term and most economists are projecting his policies will repeat this: giving tax cuts to the corporations at the expense of the national debt, where it inevitably becomes the burden of individuals. Our corporations are taking in trillions, and yet we have tax policy that has us subsidize their taxes 🙁\nI doubt many republicans actually want to admit it, but the last budget that produced significant surplus was under Clinton when taxes on corporations and the wealthy were raised following deficits generated by earlier tax cuts.\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/\nNobody likes paying taxes, but one of the reasons middle class taxes are high is because the economic elites who take home a very significant portion of the country’s GDP do not pay their fair share. It’s easy for Trump to say he’ll fix the economy for everyone, but it’s a lie. He’s a showman feeding on the desperation of the middle class who he rightfully identified as struggling, but he is just exploiting the economic struggle for political gain. His policies are not actually for the middle class, they are for himself and wealthy donors.\nDemocrats was the party of slavery, jim crow, keeping latin america poor through resource extraction and selective immigration. Now they pretend there was this “great switch” just because the south started to vote republican. \nThe parties actually did switch social roles though. The Democrats of today would identify more with the OG Republicans and visa versa.\nNaGERST,\nFor better or worse though Trump’s only plan is to stop conflicts by putting up the white flag. Take the way he resolved the Afghanistan war. He ended it yes, but it was by way of putting up the white flag for the taliban to take over.\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/568154-trumps-deal-with-the-taliban-set-the-stage-for-the-afghan-collapse/\nTrump’s plan for Ukraine is expected to be the same. Put up a white flag and let the russian invasion stand.\nSome people won’t mind this because they feel we shouldn’t be involved in international affairs, but it is reminiscent of our attempts to stay out of previous world wars. How did that work out? Coalitions like NATO were formed to never allow such things to ever happen again. For better or worse politicians that seek to retreat from NATO and the protection of international boundaries in general virtually guarantees a repeat.\nIn the short term, people in the US may feel indifferent thanks in large part to the physical isolation that separates us, but just as in the past this indifference leads to countries falling one at a time. Trump doesn’t mind because he’s all in on dictators ruling the world, but it leads to the fall of democracy worldwide. It’s just surprising how many people are oblivious to this and nonchalantly elect the would be dictators who favor this collapse.\nThis is is exactly why so many high level republicans: congressmen, DOJ staff, military generals, whitehouse aides, etc spoke against Trump. He is a danger to the constitution and democracy, but the danger is even more poignant now that all of them have lost their jobs  🙁\nI mean Google as a company is very much anti-Trump and has been manipulating search results and youtube contents against him. I think they were also the #1 corporate sponsor for Kamala Harris. If he’s not completely braindead (who knows) he’ll try to minimize Google’s influence and power.\nI mean they did specifically state that advocacy is still part of the mission, just not a separate organizational unit.\nI love Firefox to death, but I hate to admit I’ve been forced to move to other browsers. This really feels self-inflicted.\nTheir biggest misstep by far was abandoning the embedded capabilities to “streamline development.” In large part all this really allowed developers to do was spaghetti-code the browser, sacrificing all of the roads Mozilla could have gone down outside the browser. Meanwhile Webkit proliferated into multiple projects that offer exceptionally clean embedded experiences, which is why we have Chrome, Edge, Electron, Brave, Opera, Steam, OBS, VSCode, various web crawlers, and about a dozen other high-profile apps using it.\nImagine for 5 seconds the free development and sponsorships Mozilla would be getting today if they had an embedded option. Look at what was happening with Servo! Samsung, Meta, and a lot of big players were like “Yes! We will contribute to this. Embedded option good. Like Mozilla. No Google.” and then Mozilla in its infinite wisdom was like “We’re going to piss this all away, even though long-term this would help make us independent from Google and competitive with Chrome. Who needs other companies contributing to our code? What is this? Open source?”\nThey had every opportunity to really push their strengths as an open project, but Mozilla seems to prefer isolating itself at every opportunity. I’m frustrated because I don’t think it’s too late – but we’re getting closer and closer to the point where it will be.\nMozilla: Open the f*ck up. Get something embedding into something else. Make your engine viable outside Firefox so major companies wanting the hell away from Chrome contribute and use it. Making your engine – and its divorce from Manifest V3 limitations – common enough that your technology does the advocating through raw competition. Firefox is one application competing against an ecosystem – having a single browser isn’t going to work anymore. Chrome has hundreds of stakeholders now who refuse to let it die. Mozilla, by not getting embedded, has limited itself to one stakeholder – itself.\nI switched to Librewolf today, and I think that’s going to be final. Most of the things where it doesn’t work are edge cases; as for the lack of dark mode due to privacy implications, my shitty eyes need Darkreader anyway. Also it’s very obviously faster than stock Firefox, gee I wonder why.\nHelp keep OSNews alive!\n",

    "content": "\n\nThe open-source software (OSS) industry is developing the core software for the global infrastructure, to the point that even some proprietary software giants adopt Linux servers for their cloud services. Still, it has never been able to get organized by creating representative bodies capable of giving an organic response to issues such as those raised at the European level by the Cyber Resilience Act.\n\nI have been advocating for years the need to transform a movement based on the enthusiasm of individuals into something structured, which represents its market value (according to some estimates, over 100 billion euros in Europe alone).\nOf course, the challenge is to carry out the transformation without distorting the movement, because the goal is not to reproduce the world of proprietary software and its structural dependence on the lobby system, but to bring the same kind of innovative approach from software to organizations.\nThe Cyber Resilience Act was a shock that awakened many people from their comfort zone: How dare the “technical” representatives of the European Union question the security of open-source software? The answer is very simple: because we never told them, and they assumed it was because no one was concerned about security.\nThis is a short-sighted view but is representative of the lack of awareness of open-source software even among insiders, which unfortunately is a direct consequence of both very little attention to communication and the lack of a shared strategy on common issues, such as security.\nThe Heartbleed and Log4Shell incidents have created the perception that no one is looking after the security of open-source software. As if the global infrastructure, which rests on the shoulders of many servers and network equipment based on Linux, works by pure chance or by a lucky coincidence.\nAt the end, the Cyber Resilience Act was approved by the EU legislators with several changes that made it acceptable. The most important is the creation of the “open source steward”.\nThe open source steward is any legal person (other than a manufacturer) whose purpose is to: \nConsequently, the provision of free and open-source software products with digital elements that are not monetized by their manufacturers is not considered a commercial activity and is not subject to the same rules set by the Cyber Resilience Act for commercial software.\nThe CRA requires software with automatic updates to roll out security updates automatically by default, while allowing users to opt out (when feasible, security updates should be separated from feature updates).  \nCompanies must conduct a cyber risk assessment before a product is released and throughout 10 years or its expected lifecycle, and must notify the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA of any incidents within 24 hours of becoming aware of them, as well as take measures to resolve them. In addition to that, software products must carry the CE marking to show that they meet a minimum level of cybersecurity checks.\nOpen-source stewards will have to care about the security of their products but will not be asked to follow these rules. \nIn exchange, they will have to improve the communication and sharing of best security practices, which are already in place, although they have not always been shared. So, the first action was to create a project to standardize them, for the entire open-source software industry.\nOne of the most active and structured organizations during the process of revising the first version of the Cyber Security Act was Eclipse Foundation. Therefore, it was logical that a joint project for standardizing best security practices would find its “home” within it and be open to all open-source organizations and projects.\nThe project is called the Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group. (For technical aspects, there is a GitLab repo.)\nThe project will enter the operational phase in early 2025, ready for the Cyber Resilience Act, which will come into effect in 2026 at EU level, and in 2027 at the level of individual states, with the hope that they will transpose the law properly on a country-by-country basis.\nThe project has many members – large companies such as Mercedes and Nokia, Eclipse Foundation projects, and some open-source foundations, including The Document Foundation – and will welcome additional ones. \nI am confident about the success of the initiative. I think it is important to point out how the circumstances – the fear that we are close to the disappearance of the open-source software industry – have woken people and made it clear how the divisions of the past were meaningless, especially in the face of the compactness of the proprietary software industry.\nIt is probably the right time for the open-source software industry to become a real industry, with shared best practices (instead of the traditional “my bit is better than yours”), shared communication (instead of the traditional lack of communication), and the ability to bring forward issues in the common interest of open-source software.\nWe have started on the right path, but there is still a long, long way to go.\n",

    "content": "Российских разработчиков, связанных с компаниями под санкциями, удалили из списка мейнтейнеров ядра Linux. Это произошло в преддверии запрета для госсектора на использование зарубежного софта, в первую очередь операционной системы Windows, и массового перехода российских государственных и муниципальных организаций, госпредприятий и частных компаний, работающих по госконтрактам, на российские ОС, которые как раз работают на ядрах Linux. В поисках решения проблемы Минцифры РФ предложило создать альтернативное Linux-сообщество, в котором бы объединились разработчики из дружественных России стран.\nМы спросили разработчиков ОС на базе Linux и экспертов ИТ-рынка, как эта ситуация повлияет на импортозамещение и создание национальных операционных систем.\n\nОтстранение российских разработчиков, связанных с компаниями под санкциями, не является критичной проблемой для российской ИТ-отрасли, считает большинство опрошенных «Компьютеррой» экспертов. Они напоминают, что Linux — проект с открытым исходным кодом, и доступ к нему сохраняется даже после исключения российских разработчиков из сообщества, поэтому российские компании вполне могут продолжать работу над своими ОС.\n«Все российские операционные системы работают на ядре Linux. Но само ядро никому не принадлежит, исходный код открыт для всех желающих. Запретить его использовать невозможно».\nАлександр Беслик, IT-директор HFLabs\nОн подчеркнул, что у Linux нет как таковой команды разработчиков, а есть множество сторонних компаний и отдельных программистов, которые заинтересованы в развитии этого ядра. При этом отстраненные от работы над ядром ОС программисты смогут продолжать реализовывать свои решения на уровне корпоративных ОС.\n«Такой сценарий с доработками существовал и раньше: когда Linux не работает с каким-то оборудованием, разработчики той или иной компании самостоятельно его дорабатывали, вносили необходимые изменения, которые не всегда принимались в основную ветку ядра»\nАлександр Беслик, IT-директор HFLabs\nБеслик также отметил, что запретить использовать ядро Linux в сторонних ОС невозможно, поэтому «на работу российских ОС создатель Linux Линус Торвальдс никакими своими действиями повлиять не может».\n«На российских дистрибутивах Linux это явно политически мотивированное решение не скажется никак. Команды разработчиков из России продолжат использование кода в своих решениях. Также и 11 исключенных мейнтейнеров смогут продолжить предлагать свой код в Linux наряду с другими рядовыми участниками сообщества».\nАлександр Щукин, технический директор Tendence.ru\n«Безусловно, в целом это создаст дополнительные трудности, особенно в плане оперативных обновлений. Но на наш сервис KVM эта мера никак не повлияет, потому что мы планируем привлечь для его поддержки и развития российских специалистов», — говорит Максим Захаренко, СЕО «Облакотека».\n«Отстранение не коснулось всех российских разработчиков, а только тех, кто связан с подсанкционными компаниями. Сама по себе операционная система является открытой и доступной для использования в любом регионе, и текущее отстранение разработчиков не повлияет на возможность использования Linux в России», — отмечает Антон Шустиков, СЕО CakesCats. \nПо его словам, отстраненные программисты «занимались в основном тестированием драйверов и менее значительными задачами». Это подтверждает и тот факт, что в список отстраненных попали разработчики из разных стран, работающие на подсанкционные компании. Джеймс Боттомли, один из директоров Linux Foundation, пояснил, что удаление из списка мейнтейнеров связано именно с принадлежностью к компаниям из SDN-листа OFAC США.\n«Исключение российских разработчиков из команды Linux не осложнит работу отечественных ОС», — категоричен Дмитрий Тарасенко, руководитель отдела инфраструктурных решений ARinteg.\nС ним согласен и Станислав Орлов, технический директор ALMI Partner: «Исключение из команды Linux российских разработчиков непосредственно на работу нашей ОС не повлияет никак. Даже если исключение будет реальным и окончательным – в итоге какие-то конкретные устройства могут перестать поддерживаться ядром. Но это не катастрофа в масштабах всей экосистемы».\n«В нашем случае понижение статуса российских разработчиков ядра Linux не отразится на работе нашей команды, так как доступ к коду ядра из других открытых источников останется».\nЛеонид Кантер, архитектор по интеграции ОС «МСВСфера» в «Инферит»\n«Инферит ОС» является участником Консорциума по поддержке Технологического центра исследования безопасности ядра Linux, что позволяет компании использовать отечественный репозиторий в случае ограничения доступа к основному.\nТаким образом, отстранение российских разработчиков от ядра Linux, хотя и является неприятным прецедентом, не несет критической угрозы для российской IT-отрасли. Компании продолжат разрабатывать и использовать отечественные ОС на базе Linux, а открытость самого проекта гарантирует доступ к коду и возможность его модификации.\n\n\nМинцифры отреагировало на ситуацию предложением создать альтернативное Linux-сообщество. Эксперты высказывают сомнения относительно целесообразности и сложности такого проекта.\n«На данном этапе развития Linux разработка собственного ядра не имела бы смысла. Новое ядро может быть несовместимо с огромным количеством прикладного ПО», — считает Александр Щукин из Tendence.ru.\n«Разрабатывать для ОС общего назначения абсолютно другое новое ядро с нуля не имеет смысла — это будет пустой тратой денег», — еще более категоричен Александр Беслик из HFLabs. Он напоминает, что в России уже существует «Технологический центр исследования безопасности ядра Linux» при ФСТЭК.\n«Написать свое ядро – довольно серьезный шаг для отдельно взятой компании, ведь это требует значительных финансовых и человеческих ресурсов. Но вопрос уже обсуждается на уровне отрасли»\nМаксим Захаренко, СЕО «Облакотека»\nОн видит решение в объединении усилий: «Создать независимое ядро вполне возможно, если объединить усилия с другими компаниями. Лично мы готовы рассмотреть сотрудничество. Если будет написано собственное ядро, то отрасль в целом ждет вдохновляющие перспективы».\n«Разработка собственного ядра — очень трудоемкий процесс», — подробно разъясняет сложности такого подхода Станислав Орлов из ALMI Partner. Он предлагает альтернативный путь: развивать существующую версию ядра.\n«Российские патчи, вероятно, будут продолжать приниматься, но, возможно, возникнут российские форки», — рассказал РБК Иван Панченко, сооснователь и замгендиректора Postgres Professional. Он считает, что среди стран, которые потенциально могут стать участниками нового сообщества, будет Китай, «которому удалось больше других продвинуться в разработке операционных систем». \nВпрочем, Панченко выразил сомнения, что эта страна «захочет делиться своими наработками с кем-либо». Он также отмечает необходимость лидерства России в таком сообществе и нехватку разработчиков высокого уровня.\nПри этом член совета директоров НТЦ ИТ РОСА и компании «Рутек» Сергей Кравцов считает, что любые наработки, которые будут сделаны российскими программисты, глобальным сообществом Linux будут проигнорирован. \n«Не стоит ожидать, что в официальной ветке Linux будут приняты изменения от российского сообщества», – сказал Кравцов РБК. \nТаким образом, хотя идея создания альтернативного Linux-сообщества выглядит привлекательно с точки зрения технологического суверенитета, ее реализация сопряжена с серьезными трудностями. Эксперты предлагают сосредоточиться на развитии существующих российских дистрибутивов.\nНесмотря на сложности, российская ИТ-отрасль демонстрирует готовность к работе в новых условиях. Компании активно адаптируются к ситуации, привлекая российских специалистов и развивая отечественные технологии.\n«У нас в планах как раз-таки пригласить российских специалистов, которые работали над проектом Linux. Их экспертиза просто необходима для нашего сервиса KVM и других технологий виртуализации. Они смогут участвовать в поддержке и развитии сервисов, улучшении производительности и внедрении новых решений для операционных систем», — делится планами Максим Захаренко из «Облакотека».\n«Команда «Инферит ОС» является участником «Консорциума по поддержке Технологического центра исследования безопасности операционных систем на базе ядра Linux», созданном при ИСП РАН. Консорциум исследует безопасность ядра Linux и развивает его российскую ветку», — рассказал «Компьютерре» Леонид Кантер из «Инферит».\nМногие эксперты отмечают высокую квалификацию российских разработчиков. Отстраненные от проекта Linux специалисты, скорее всего, быстро найдут применение своим навыкам в российских компаниях. Более того, сама ситуация с отстранением разработчиков может стать стимулом для развития отечественной IT-отрасли.\nОтстранение российских разработчиков от ядра Linux — не катастрофа, а повод для развития отечественных технологий. Российская ИТ-отрасль обладает потенциалом для решения возникших вызовов. Планы Минцифры по созданию альтернативного Linux-сообщества требуют проработки, но фокус должен быть направлен на развитие отечественной экспертизы и создание устойчивой ИТ-инфраструктуры.\nСколько в мире океанов?\nAxoft включил в портфель систему управления ИТ-инфраструктурой Колибри-АРМ\nЛегендарный ресурс о современных технологиях, которые пришли в потребительский сегмент из научных сфер.

    "content": "Pubblicit\ufffd\n07 Novembre 2024 9\nUn’ottimizzazione apparentemente minima nel codice di Linux, realizzata dal creatore stesso del kernel del sistema operativo, Linus Torvalds, ha portato a un miglioramento misurabile nelle prestazioni multithread. \nQuesto cambiamento, contenuto nel commit dal nome tecnico e criptico \"x86/uaccess: Avoid barrier_nospec() in 64-bit copy_from_user()\", introduce un’ottimizzazione che rafforza la sicurezza del sistema contro le note falle Meltdown e Spectre, due famigerate vulnerabilità emerse nel 2018 e che, purtroppo, continuano a rappresentare una minaccia attuale.\nIl nuovo codice deriva da un primo tentativo di miglioramento, proposto dallo sviluppatore di Red Hat, Josh Poimboeuf, che Torvalds ha rivisitato per ridurre l’impatto sulle prestazioni. In effetti, come riportato dallo stesso Torvalds, \"Il kernel test robot riporta un miglioramento del 2,6% nel benchmark per_thread_ops\". Anche se questa percentuale può sembrare piccola, in ambito tecnologico si tratta di un miglioramento in termini di efficienza non trascurabile, specialmente se associato a una funzione di sicurezza.\n \nNella sua ottimizzazione, Torvalds ha eliminato l'uso dell’API barrier_nospec() che serviva a impedire l’esecuzione speculativa di alcune istruzioni del processore, un meccanismo di calcolo predittivo per cercare di anticipare il codice da eseguire prima che sia effettivamente richiesto, molto utile nei moderni processori ma che ha mostrato vulnerabilità in quanto  le previsioni sbagliate possono essere sfruttate per accedere a informazioni sensibili, come possibile tramite attacchi Meltdown e Spectre. Questa nuova soluzione utilizza un sistema di \"masking\" per gestire le operazioni non valide in copy_from_user(), evitando l’esecuzione speculativa in modo più efficiente.\nQuesto tipo di interventi è cruciale per un sistema come Linux, ampiamente utilizzato su server e infrastrutture il cui la sicurezza è una priorità assoluta. Tuttavia, per Torvalds, da sempre attento alle prestazioni, questi miglioramenti alla sicurezza, che spesso rallentano il sistema, rappresentano un compromesso non sempre facile da accettare. Su macchine isolate, come computer desktop o laptop non connessi alla rete, è possibile disabilitare alcune di queste protezioni per guadagnare in prestazioni, sebbene solo a chi è consapevole dei rischi e in grado di gestirli.\nQuesta patch mostra ancora una volta la competenza e l’esperienza di Torvalds nella gestione del kernel di Linux e delle complessità dell'architettura x86. Il suo lavoro è fondamentale non solo per la sicurezza, ma anche per mantenere elevata l’efficienza del sistema operativo, un equilibrio che solo pochi al mondo sanno mantenere.\nPer questo motivo, la Linux Foundation continua a garantirgli uno stipendio annuale elevato, da oltre un milione di dollari, riconoscendo il suo valore come figura centrale nel mondo open-source. L’intervento di Torvalds è l’esempio perfetto della sua abilità di coniugare le esigenze di sicurezza con quelle di prestazione, confermando la sua leadership e la sua importanza come “comandante” di uno dei sistemi operativi più utilizzati al mondo.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t19 Novembre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t31 Ottobre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t29 Ottobre 2024\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t18 Ottobre 2024\n\t\nIl mondo civilizzato non ha bisogno della spazzatura russa\nLa stima e lo stipendio ci sta anche visto che \ufffd il creatore di linux che gira su miliardi di dispositivi tutti i giorni.Per\ufffd fare una lode cos\ufffd grande per una singola commit mi sembra un po' assurdo.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        Wie die Anerkennung der Gemeinnützigkeit Open-Source-Projekten helfen kann, erklärt Mirko Böhm von der Linux Foundation Europe im Gespräch.\n      \n\n      (Bild: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock.com, Bearbeitung: heise online)\n    \n\n      \n        \n\n      (Bild: Böhm)\n    \nErst kürzlich haben verschiedene Vereine in einem offenen Brief von der Politik gefordert, mehr in Open-Source-Projekte zu investieren. \"Eine moderne Verwaltung und die Förderung von Open Source [...] ist ein entscheidender Faktor, um die digitale Transformation der öffentlichen Hand nachhaltig voranzutreiben – unabhängig von politischen Wechseln oder Koalitionsdynamiken\", heißt es von dem unter anderem aus der AG Kritis, ein aus der AG Nachhaltige Digitalisierung und Wikimedia bestehendes Bündnis. Eine Unterstützung für Open-Source-Projekte stellt jedoch auch die Anerkennung der Gemeinnützigkeit dar – in Deutschland ein kompliziertes Unterfangen. 2021 hatte das für Mastodon zunächst geklappt, doch das hat sich inzwischen wieder geändert. Warum konkrete Vorgaben bezüglich der Gemeinnützigkeit Open-Source-Unternehmen helfen würden und über eine nachhaltige Open-Source-Entwicklung haben wir mit Mirko Böhm, Senior Director für Community Entwicklung bei der Linux Foundation Europe, gesprochen. Aufgrund seiner jahrzehntelangen Erfahrung wurde er bereits als Dinosaurier im Bereich Open Source vorgestellt.\nheise online: Welche Unterschiede gibt es im Open-Source-Bereich weltweit?\nMirko Böhm: Die Länder in Europa unterscheiden sich in dem Punkt nicht groß voneinander. Es gibt immer die beiden Lager, die die Open Source einfach als pragmatisches Mittel zur Zusammenarbeit betrachten und die, die es eher als gesellschaftliche Strömung sehen – als ein politisches Mittel. Diese Strömungen finden sich überall auf der Welt. Nur China ist anders. China spielt eine besondere Rolle, denn es ist ein sehr großes Land mit vielen Tech-Unternehmen, die sonst wenig mit uns zusammenarbeiten. Wir haben wenig Einblick, was dort vor sich geht. Die Linux Foundation ist die Heimat von vielen global aufgestellten Projekten wie der Linux Kernel, Yocto oder Kubernetes. Bei uns sammeln sich eher Menschen, die Open Source als pragmatisches Mittel für Zusammenarbeit sehen. Auch in den EU-Staaten haben wir ein weit verteiltes Netzwerk an Mitwirkenden. Dafür gibt es in den USA die Linux Foundation, in Europa die Linux Foundation Europe.\nEs gibt manchmal Diskussionen um die Begriffe Freie Software und Open Source. Wie ist Ihre Sicht darauf?\nDie Begriffe sind historisch gewachsen. Man könnte sich stundenlang darüber unterhalten, wie sie sich im Detail unterscheiden. Wir nutzen da die Anforderungen \"use, study, modify, and distribute\", also Verwenden, Verstehen, Anpassen, Verteilen. Und es gibt auf der anderen Seite die Open-Source-Definition, die aber im Prinzip auf das Gleiche hinausläuft. Die Software wird jedem zu jedem Zweck zur Verfügung gestellt und hat damit keine Diskriminierung in Richtung des Users. Der Zugang zu Technologie kann eine Art Menschenrecht sein.\nInwiefern können Änderungen bei der Gemeinnützigkeit von Bedeutung sein?\nDer Begriff Gemeinnützigkeit gibt an, dass eine Tätigkeit der Allgemeinheit selbstlos hilft, das funktioniert gerade auch bei Technologien, genauer gesagt der Entwicklung von Technologien, die der Gemeinschaft unter einer Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt, die die Anforderungen der Open-Source-Definition erfüllen. Diese haben alle Mindestanforderungen. Und es gibt die Frage, was hat das für einen Einfluss auf unsere Gesellschaft? Beiträge zur Entwicklung von Linux zum Beispiel sollten immer als dem Gemeinwohl dienend betrachtet werden. Bezüglich der Software-Pflege gibt es verschiedene Sichtweisen. Es gibt Unternehmen, die sehr liberal Beiträge zu Linux-Projekten machen, ohne zu monetarisieren, die die Software zum Beispiel selbst verwenden wollen. Interessanterweise ist Microsoft da ein gutes Beispiel. Andere wie Amazon monetarisieren sehr stark. Für die Entwicklung gibt es eine offene Lizenz, das ist erst mal immer ein Beitrag zum Gemeinwohl, der positiv ist. Beiträge zu freier und offener Software tragen grundsätzlich positiv zum Gemeinwohl bei, weil sie gemeinsam den Stand an frei zugänglichen Technologien definieren. Aber ein Beitrag zum Gemeinwohl macht noch keine Gemeinnützigkeit, dafür muss die Technologie auch allen zur Weiterentwicklung offenstehen.\nGibt es auch Lizenzen, bei denen Sie sagen, die würden wir jetzt nicht mit hineinnehmen?\nGrundsätzlich ist die Open-Source-Definition auch hier ein guter Maßstab. Es gibt die, die die Verpflichtung mit sich bringen, dass man seinen eigenen Source Code auch unter die gleiche Lizenz stellen muss. Aber die vier Grundrechte, die quasi allen gegeben werden, gelten für alle akzeptierten Open-Source-Lizenzen. Jede Open-Source-Lizenz macht aus der lizenzierten Software ein öffentliches Gut. Schwierigkeiten hätte ich zum Beispiel eher mit Lizenzen, die Patentrechte ausschließen. Diese sind auch zu Recht nicht als Open-Source-Lizenzen anerkannt, weil sie das Ergebnis nicht jedem zu jedem Zweck zur Verfügung stellen. Viele neueren Lizenz-Erfindungen versuchen genau das auszuhebeln. Sie sind nicht ausreichend, um aus Software ein öffentliches Gut zu machen.\nFür mich ist eines der Grundprinzipien von Open Source, dass die Mitwirkung freiwillig und jedem offen ist. Dass jeder, der etwas beiträgt, das aus eigenen Stücken tut. Und ja, es gibt diese fast schon klassische Diskussion um vertikale Integration, wo die Integratoren (oft Cloud Provider) wenig in die Entwicklung zurückgeben. Aber es hat auch Gründe, die ganz praktisch sind. Zum Beispiel, dass sie manchmal gar nicht wollen, dass sich die Software schnell weiterentwickelt, weil sie diese in ihrem Produkt integrieren. Sie wollen die Software weitestgehend stabil und fehlerfrei haben, aber nicht unbedingt ständig neue Funktionen oder neue Versionen entwickeln.\nEs gibt auch Bedenken, dass die Gemeinnützigkeit ausgenutzt wird. Wie lässt sich dem vorbeugen?\nEs besteht die Gefahr, dass eine Art von Openwashing stattfindet. Erst durch eine offene Kollaboration steht die Mitwirkung wirklich jedem offen. Ein offener, kollaborativer Prozess erfordert eine neutrale Governance, bei der jeder freiwillig mitwirken kann. Diese freiwillige Beteiligung ist ein Schlüsselelement dessen, was wir als \"offene Governance\" (Open Governance) bezeichnen. Dieses Prinzip wird von großen Open Source Foundations verfolgt, da es ihr Grundprinzip ist. Im Gegensatz dazu ist bei einem Unternehmen, das eine Software veröffentlicht, aber keine weiteren Änderungen von Dritten zulässt, weil es sich um ein kommerzielles Produkt handelt, keine offene Governance gegeben. Solch ein Projekt ist zwar von der Lizenz her Open Source, aber der Entwicklungsprozess steht nicht allen Interessierten offen. Open-Source-Lizenzierung und ein offener Entwicklungsprozess, also eine offene Zusammenarbeit basierend auf Freiwilligkeit, müssen Hand in Hand gehen, wie z. B. bei der Linux Foundation, um ein Open-Source-Projekt als gemeinnützig zu betrachten.\nWir haben in den letzten Monaten einige Unternehmensentscheidungen gesehen, bei denen Open-Source-Produkte zu proprietären umgewandelt wurden, das ist ein Beispiel dafür. Wenn ein Unternehmen alle Rechte an der Software hat, dann können sie zum Beispiel die Kunden anfüttern. Und wenn die Software dann in die Infrastruktur integriert ist, können sie umschalten und sagen, wir stellen das unter eine proprietäre Lizenz. Und das ist für mich eine Schwierigkeit, die mit offener Kollaboration nicht auftritt. Ich würde die Gemeinnützigkeit tatsächlich an eine offene Kollaboration knüpfen.\nGibt es Gründe, warum Open Source hier nicht als gemeinnützig anerkannt ist?\nReine Softwareentwicklung ist in fast keinem Land ein Grund für Gemeinnützigkeit. Es muss immer mit einem Zweck verbunden sein, so ist es in Deutschland auch. Es soll ein gemeinnütziger Zweck verwirklicht werden, Volksbildung wird oft als Aufhänger verwendet. In den USA ist es ähnlich, das kann man eigentlich vergleichen. Es gibt auch dort die gemeinnützigen Organisationen, aber da legt es auch die Steuerbehörde fest. Die Linux Foundation hat eine Tochtergesellschaft, die heißt Linux Foundation Charities und dort sind alle gemeinnützigen Projekte aufgehängt.\nEin Problem ist immer, dass mit der Gemeinnützigkeit Einschränkungen bei der Geschäftstätigkeit einhergehen, etwa Dokumentationspflichten oder Einschränkungen bei erlaubten Tätigkeiten (wie etwa das allseits beliebte Verkaufen von Merchandise). Und deswegen setzen wir nicht die gesamte Dienstleistung als gemeinnützig auf, sondern nur einen Teil. Eine der größten Schwierigkeiten in Deutschland ist die Angabe eines gemeinnützigen Zwecks, der einen festgelegten Katalog entnommen werden muss.\nEin Beispiel dafür ist die Mastodon GmbH, der die Gemeinnützigkeit entzogen wurde, weil sie auch nicht-gemeinnützige Aktivitäten durchgeführt hat. Das Finanzamt hat Mastodon ohne Angabe von Gründen die Gemeinnützigkeit entzogen. Das heißt, notwendig wäre an der Stelle, Vorgaben zu machen, welche Geschäftstätigkeit dann als gemeinnützig gesehen werden kann. Im KDE-Verein, der in Deutschland sitzt, habe ich damals an der Gemeinnützigkeit gearbeitet. Da mussten wir uns mit Dingen wie Event-Organisationen, Merchandise-Shops oder ähnlichem teilweise getrennt aufstellen, weil die nicht mehr als gemeinnützig gelten. Es wäre hilfreich, wenn der Gesetzgeber klarer Vorgaben machen könnte.\nUnd wie wird sich die Arbeitsweise bei der Linux Foundation ändern, wenn es für den Verein die Gemeinnützigkeit auch in Deutschland gibt?\nWir haben zwei Standbeine, eines in Kalifornien und eines in Brüssel. Das heißt, wenn sich in Deutschland das Gemeinnützigkeitsrecht ändert, betrifft das dann Unternehmen, die an uns Mitgliedsbeiträge leisten. Und das ist dann auch eine steuerliche Frage. Und für Unternehmen, die an uns Mitgliedsbeiträge leisten, sind diese Beiträge auch jetzt schon Betriebsausgaben. Das heißt, die sind auch so abzugsfähig. Wir haben eine sehr diverse, internationale Mitgliedschaft, viele auch aus Deutschland. Das heißt eben, wenn die Gemeinnützigkeit in Deutschland anerkannt wird, betrifft das bei uns nur einen Bruchteil.\nDeswegen denke ich, das Thema ist interessanter, ist wichtiger für Community-getriebene Vereine gerade in Deutschland. Ich würde mir wünschen, dass es für die Community das Leben leichter macht. Und dass wir denen auf diese Weise auch Anerkennung geben. Auch wenn sich damit für die Linux Foundation nicht wahnsinnig viel ändert, freuen wir uns, wenn die Open-Source-Community hier vom Gesetzgeber unterstützt wird und Anerkennung findet.\nWie sieht Ihrer Ansicht nach eine nachhaltige Open-Source-Entwicklung aus?\nZuallererst muss man verstehen, was die Natur eines Open-Source-Projekts und was die Natur eines Unternehmens ist. Ein Open-Source-Projekt ist definitionsgemäß nicht differenzierend. Wir geben es frei heraus, sodass es für jeden Zweck genutzt werden kann. Was die Software kann, ist für niemanden ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal für die Benutzererfahrung. Jedem anderen, der die Software nutzt, steht die gleiche Funktionalität zur Verfügung. Es spielt auch nicht unbedingt eine besondere Rolle, wer die Software geschrieben hat. Beiträge müssen also aus freien Stücken geleistet werden, und ohne die Erwartung einer konkreten Gegenleistung.\nAls Nutzer bin ich den Kernentwicklern dankbar, aber ich muss keine Beziehung zu den Personen haben. Es gibt keine Verpflichtung, etwas zurückzugeben. Das geht in zwei Richtungen. Man kann als Anwender dann nicht sagen, der Bug muss bitte bis Montag gefixt werden. Wenn der Maintainer sagt, er hat jetzt keine Zeit, dann passiert es nicht. Er wird aber auch nicht verhindern, dass jemand anders am Code arbeitet. Das ist offene Kollaboration. Der Maintainer darf sich dann aber auch nicht über die Änderungen beschweren. Das ist die Natur von Open Source – die Mitwirkenden und die Anwender müssen nicht miteinander verhandeln.\nAls Argument gegen Open Source wird oft gesagt, dass diese aus solchen Gründen nicht sicher ist. Was sagen Sie dazu?\nDieses Maintainer-Problem haben wir natürlich. Das ist eine komplexe Sache. Wenn sich die Natur des Projektes ändert, wenn aus einem Hobbyprojekt etwas Größeres wird und sich die Governance aber nicht ändert, dann ist das nicht lange tragbar. Dann ist es wichtig, dass auch anderen Raum gegeben wird, um am Code zu arbeiten und eine Community aufzubauen. Dafür müssen sich die ursprünglichen Entwickler manchmal zurückziehen, zum Beispiel, wenn sie das etwa zeitlich nicht mehr schaffen. Vielen fällt es aber schwer, ihr \"Baby\" abzugeben. Eine Foundation ist dann besser geeignet, um das Projekt fortzuführen.\nSicherheit ist für mich ein Supply-Chain-Thema. Kommerzielle Anbieter integrieren Open-Source-Komponenten in ihre Produkte, dadurch kommen sie beim Nutzer an. Beim Thema Security muss geprüft werden, an welcher Stelle die Verantwortung dafür eigentlich aufgehängt wird. Und das funktioniert auch nicht bei der Community, weil die Community fast nie kein End-User-Produkt-Anbieter ist, sondern Bausteine entwickelt. Wenn die Bausteine in kommerziellen Produkten verwendet werden, dann muss man darauf achten, dass diese konkreten Produkte sicher sind. Deswegen halte ich das Thema Sicherheit für essenziell. Software-Sicherheit ist ein wichtiges Thema, und es ist auch notwendig, dass das regulatorisch und ökonomisch sinnvoll abgebildet wird (siehe den Cyber Resilience Act und die Product Liability Directive).\n\n\n\n(mack)\n\n\n\n    Keine News verpassen!

    "content": "If you’re tired of Windows 11’s limitations and crave a more open, customizable environment, Fedora Linux 41 might be the answer. This latest release of Fedora Linux arrives early, with new features that cater to both power users and those looking to get more out of their computers. With a strong foundation in open-source technology and support from an active community, Fedora Linux 41 combines stability, versatility, and the latest desktop environments. It’s a solid choice for anyone considering a switch from Windows.\nFedora Linux 41 provides a polished experience with updates across GNOME and KDE, enhancing desktop options. GNOME 47 now comes with Fedora Workstation, introducing a new default terminal, Ptyxis, that offers a lightweight option for command-line tasks. KDE Plasma users will appreciate the latest Plasma 6.2, offering seamless improvements, including built-in drawing tablet configuration, better HDR support for multimedia, and accessibility options like Sticky Keys and color-blindness filters. Fedora’s attention to detail here makes both GNOME and KDE feel snappy and modern, unlike the sometimes cumbersome experience of Windows.\nOne highlight of Fedora Linux 41 is its enhanced support for ARM-based devices, including Raspberry Pi and Apple Silicon. Fedora’s KDE Spin for AArch64 is now “release-blocking,” meaning bugs affecting these devices can hold up the release to ensure quality, especially with projects like Fedora Asahi Remix bringing Fedora to Apple Silicon. ARM users can expect a refined, efficient experience built for these popular devices.\nFor those exploring Linux beyond traditional desktops, Fedora Linux 41 expands into mobile with KDE Plasma Mobile Spin and Kinoite Mobile. Plasma Mobile’s interface, originally designed for phones, adapts well to tablets and 2-in-1 laptops, bringing Fedora to an even broader range of devices. With Kinoite Mobile available as an Atomic Desktop container image, Fedora Linux 41 invites mobile users into the open-source ecosystem.\nUnder the hood, Fedora Linux 41 introduces general improvements that impact all users. The new power profiles daemon, “tuned,” replaces the previous power-profiles-daemon, providing more control over power consumption and compatibility for developers. Fedora 41 also enhances IPU6 camera support, letting users take advantage of the latest laptop webcams out of the box, perfect for video calls and remote work.\nFedora Linux 41 is available for download now, offering a powerful open-source alternative to Windows 11. For those seeking more freedom and fewer restrictions, switching to Fedora could be the right move. Ready to make the change?

    "content": "The factory has grown\nTo say that Factorio: Space Age throws out the rulebook is an understatement. It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.\nSpace Age seems entirely content with the first few hours, even the first few dozen, being pretty much exactly the same as it always was. Aside from a handful of quality of life changes, you basically just play a new game of Factorio. Punch rocks and trees. Place miners on iron and copper. Spin plates that keep everything manually fed until you have some boilers and steam engines up and running. Automate your first science packs. Research your first few techs so you can do everything again, but bigger and better. If you never clicked with Factorio before, Space Age is unlikely to change anything for you, because you're unlikely to hang around long enough to see what Space Age truly has in store.\nMe though, I've always been a factory game addict. I blasted through the first 40 automation-filled hours, and at last I reached the moment where the DLC truly began. In Space Age there are multiple new planets to explore, but first you need to construct ships capable of getting you there (and preferably back) in one piece. The moment I started to craft my first rocket, my production levels ground to a halt.\nNone of my previous knowledge helped me up there in alien territory. I had to slowly piece together how to send bits of foundation and other items up to my ship to start expanding it; how to place asteroid-grabbers on the perimeter and then filter the different asteroid types through specialised crushers to extract new resources like carbon and ice. How to then turn those into rocket fuel, and then automate ammo production for my gun turrets so I could blast apart large asteroid chunks before they turned my creation into a lonely, silent Hindenburg.\nLike a pump placed exactly as far down the pipeline as needed to ensure throughput, Space Age came along at exactly the point in my playthrough where I might ordinarily have started to feel burnt out. Aboard my ship, it not only felt like starting a new game, it felt like learning Factorio all over again. Goodbye, efficiency and careful calculations. Greetings, endless bottlenecks, asteroid collisions, and staring at item descriptions without even a modicum of gorm. It sounds frustrating, but I loved every moment. If I ever got tired, I'd just chill out and watch the gorgeous animations on the spaceship. The foundations unfurling themselves bit by bit like chunky metal origami. The Doc Ock tentacles of the asteroid collectors, yoinking nearby chunks of metal and carbon out of space. The animations have always been stellar in Factorio, but the new buildings are works of art.\nEventually I got to my first new planet - Vulcanus. I jettisoned from my (thankfully still working) spaceship Hephaestus, and landed on a gorgeously hellish, lava-filled landscape. My inventory had to be completely empty to even start a journey through space, so when I landed on Vulcanus, I was starting from scratch. And the rulebook had once again been shredded.\nVulcanus feels truly different. Not just in the atmosphere and landscape, but the processes themselves. Familiar resources were present, but the ways I got hold of them were completely different. There were no iron or copper patches on the ground. Instead, I had to hit rocks to give me iron, copper, stone, and a new resource called Tungsten. Before I could do anything worthwhile, I needed a power source. But what to use? I was close to the sun, so solar power was a strong option, but I didn't have the resources to build a single battery, and I didn't fancy my entire factory switching off every evening. Steam power sounded good, but how could I get water for steam on a lava planet?\nTurns out, all you need is some sulfuric acid, pumped in through geysers, and then you feed it into a chemical plant with a bit of a new resource called calcite, and that's enough to get oodles of super-heated steam. You can then cool the steam to produce water, before feeding it into a familiar boiler and steam engine setup to produce steam at a lower, more useful temperature. Hey presto, you've got steam power on Vulcanus! And what a delightful process of discovery it was. Course, I realised later that night that I didn't need to do any of that; all I needed was to pump the original super-heated steam into some turbines for huge amounts of energy. But hey, now I know for next time.\nThe whole purpose of going to Vulcanus is to produce the planet's unique type of science pack: Metallurgic Science. Each planet has its own type of science which you need to automate if you want to research everything and get to the endgame. Gradually, I saw possibilities. I could pipe magma into the new Foundry building for an unlimited supply of iron and copper; I could use sulfuric acid to liquify coal into oil to make plastic for circuit boards; I could venture out into the fog of war to find some Tungsten deposits... Except that the landscape was crawling with colossal worms called demolishers which slaughtered me at a single touch and were almost impossible to kill. The first time I saw a (small) demolisher rumbling along the outskirts of my base, I actually laughed nervously at the screen.\nAt least the demolishers were passive. They'll leave you alone unless you disturb their territory with buildings, or shoot them in the bum with a tank shell. Conversely, I soon discovered through repeated alerts that I'd perhaps left my home planet Nauvis a little hastily, as everything continues to run in realtime throughout the entire solar system no matter where you are. Up in orbit, my ship Hephaestus continued to be caressed by asteroids. And back on Nauvis, my turrets steadily ran out of ammo and were being destroyed by Biter attacks. I could see it all unfolding, but I couldn't do anything about it until I found a way off-planet. That was a new kind of tension I hadn't felt before in Factorio, and it was brilliant.\nThankfully some fast, focused work allowed me to cobble together a rocket and head back up to Hephaestus. 15 hours of worms and lava was enough to make Hephaestus feel quite nostalgic. It was a real moment of triumph. And then, a few minutes later, that same feeling was magnified as I returned to Nauvis, where I'd spend the next several hours shoring up defences, replacing depleted resource patches, and just generally making sure things would more adequately handle my next absence.\nAll the new interstellar systems and processes do remind me just how long it took to become even passably knowledgeable in Factorio. Space Age does nothing to help onboard new players and is as dense as ever. Probably much more so. Thankfully, the DLC does come alongside the free 2.0 update, which provides all players (of both Space Age and the base game itself) with a huge variety of quality of life improvements, as well as a couple of fundamental changes. There are new (far simpler and more satisfying) fluid dynamics, excellent new terrain generation, and a tonne of other tiny changes. Most of those changes would sound laughably inconsequential for non-addicts, but for automation husks like me, they're music to my ears. And new features like the Factoriopedia and an excellent series of tips and tricks (complete with illustrative videos) available at a click do help to cut the learning curve and make things a bit more intuitive. None of that stops Factorio from being one of the most complex, confusing, consuming games I've played. With Space Age, the journey is longer and more mind-boggling than ever, but there's also no better time to start.\nAll of Wube's signature depth and engineering quality is present in nearly every part of Space Age. There's a lightness of touch at work with all these new features and changes, a lessening of complexity in some areas and a heightening in others, all in the pursuit of fun and fascination. I sadly haven't seen any of the other planets on offer besides Vulcanus, even after 100 hours in my save file. But several years of some of the most satisfying, addictive, cerebral fun I've ever had in a game has convinced me that Wube really know what they're talking about. And from everything I've seen so far, Space Age is what Factorio was always meant to be.\nUpdate: since writing this review I've started work on Gleba, and good lord, if I thought Vulcanus threw out the rulebook...

La decisione, entrata in vigore lunedì scorso, segue la precedente mossa di rendere il software gratuito per uso personale all'inizio di quest'anno. Le versioni Pro di Fusion (per Mac) e Workstation (per Windows e Linux) non sono, difatti, più disponibili per l'acquisto.\nQuesta mossa arriva in seguito all'acquisizione di VMware da parte di Broadcom per 61 miliardi di dollari nel 2022, una delle più grandi acquisizioni tecnologiche di sempre. Da allora, Broadcom ha semplificato il portfolio di prodotti VMware, eliminando molte offerte esistenti e spingendo le aziende verso soluzioni in abbonamento come Cloud Foundation o vSphere Foundation.\n\n\nSecondo un rapporto di Business Insider citato da Tom's Hardware, alcuni clienti aziendali hanno segnalato aumenti significativi dei prezzi dopo l'acquisizione. Un cliente aziendale anonimo ha dichiarato di aver visto un aumento del 175% nei prezzi, paragonando la situazione a un \"sequestro\" a causa della difficoltà di passare a soluzioni alternative.\n\n                    Valido dal 21 Novembre al 02 Dicembre\n                     - \n                    \n                    Risparmia su centinaia di prodotti!\n                \n\n                        Segui il Black Friday con Tom's Hardware!\n                    \n\n                        Le migliori offerte selezionate dai più grandi store online con sconti fino al 70%!\n                    \nVMware ha assicurato che i contratti commerciali esistenti rimarranno validi e che i clienti riceveranno lo stesso livello di supporto fino alla fine dei loro contratti.

    "content": "My thoughts on my election as a member of the Django Software Foundation (DSF) board of directors.\nI’m living an intense period, but at the same time stimulating, from various points of view: after a job change in early September, I participated as a speaker at DjangoCon US 2024, I started the third session of Djangonaut Space as a navigator, I started to participate in the organization of PyCon Italia 2025 and also of the local meetings of Python Pescara.\nAlmost at the same time as all this I signed up for a new swimming pool. Swimming is the sport that helps me most of all to decompress and release the stress of the day. I think it is the first sport I have ever done, since, very small, my friends could not pronounce my name, Paolo, well, and they distorted it into “Paulo”.\nMany years later, at university, I decided to use that nickname to create my first email address, to which I added an “x”, because I was in full discovery of Linux, the GNU project and Free Software, which I was so passionate about that it was the topic of my degree thesis.\nThe aspect that most fascinated me about Free Software was, more than the technical aspect, the great unifying power that it exerted on people, who like me were passionate about technology and computer science. And since then I have always tried to continue to be part of that great community without borders.\nLanding in the Python community was a very fortunate, yet unlikely event, in a period in which many other technologies were used, especially in a city in the Italian provinces. And precisely for this reason I immediately became fond of this channel that I had with other people all over the world.\nAs I swam this evening, I reflected on the journey I have made in the Django community: when I first heard someone mention Django in 2009, when I listened to the first talks about Django at EuroPython 2011 (presented by Simon Willison and Tom Christie), when I attended my first DjangoCon Europe in 2017, and all the other stages, up to today.\nMy passion for discovery and sharing I believe have ancient roots, since I was little, when I learned to swim, and have accompanied me in my school and work choices and in my commitment to the community.\nIn this long journey I believe I have learned a lot about the people in the community and, much more, I have learned about myself through the interaction with each of them. I have realized, just in the last few weeks, that even if united by the same passion, not all members of the community share my same path, my same motivation, or my same ways of relating in the community. This aspect sometimes destabilizes me, but then it makes me grow, as a person and as a member of the community.\nMaybe all these thoughts emerged because this morning I learned, through a thousand messages, that I had been elected as a new member of the Django Software Foundation board of directors, and I wasn’t able to stop and reflect on the meaning of the thing or to share it by responding to the many congratulations.\nI have already shared my ideas about Django and the community in my nomination statement and well before in other articles, the only thing I feel like adding is that I will work to make the community a more welcoming place for everyone, whatever their personal history, their motivation for being part of it, their native language or their ways of relating.\nI feel like thanking all the people who have built this community over the years, including the other unelected candidates who participated in the elections.\nTo the members of the board, old and new, I wish good work.\nI can’t wait to start collaborating with all of you.\n— Paolo (“paulox”) Melchiorre\n",

It was developed by the Open Platform Communications (OPC) Foundation and is defined in detail in the IEC 62541 standard.\nWith the release of the Arduino_OPC_UA library we enable users to convert any product from our Arduino Opta range into an OPC UA-enabled device. \nIt’s as simple as uploading a single sketch onto your Opta and connecting it to an Ethernet network. Once uploaded, the OPC UA firmware exposes the Arduino Opta’s analog and digital inputs, the user button and LED (only Arduino Opta WiFi), as well as its relay outputs as properties that can be read from or written to using OPC UA. OPC UA communication is performed using OPC UA binary encoding via TCP sockets.\nArduino_OPC_UA is a port of the Fraunhofer open62541 library implementing IEC 62541 in highly portable C99 for both Windows and Linux targets. One serious challenge during the porting of open62541 was to decide on sensible tradeoffs concerning RAM consumption, as using OPC UAs full namespace zero (NS0) requires up to 8 MB of RAM while the STM32H747 powering the Arduino Opta has a total of 1 MB of SRAM to offer – some of which already allocated by the the Arduino framework for the Arduino Opta.\nAdditionally, Arduino_OPC_UA supports the automatic discovery, configuration and exposure as OPC UA objects of the recently released Arduino Opta expansion modules. Currently three different expansion modules exist: Arduino Opta Analog Expansion (A0602), Arduino Opta Digital Expansion with electro-mechanical relay outputs (D1608E), and with solid-state relay outputs (DS1608S). During system start-up, the Arduino Opta’s expansion bus is queried for connected expansion modules and automatically configures them and brings them online for interfacing via OPC UA.\nYou can extend the default OPC UA server to add additional OPC UA properties such as data collected from a sensor device connected to the Arduino Opta. As a demonstration, we’ve created an example showing how to collect temperature and humidity data from a Modbus RTU device (connected to the Opta’s RS485 port) and subsequently expose this data via OPC UA properties.\nHow will you use the new Arduino_OPC_UA library? Let us know in the comments below or share your newest projects on Project Hub! \n",

Vaughan-Nichols （Special to ZDNET.com） 翻訳校正： 矢倉美登里 長谷睦 （ガリレオ）\n2024-11-22 10:23\nHere's my content\n　Linux Foundation Researchは「Linux Foundation Member Summit」イベントで、オープンソースと人工知能（AI）の関係を深く掘り下げた新たなレポートを発表した。両者の関係は、時にぎすぎすする場合もあることが知られている。\n　「Shaping the Future of Generative AI（生成AIの未来を形作る）」と題されたレポートは、Linux Foundation（LF）のAI＆DataプロジェクトとCloud Native Computing Foundation（CNCF）が作成したものだ。その内容は、生成AIの未来を形作るのにオープンソースソフトウェアが不可欠であることを明かすものだ。その点は、私たちも痛いほどわかっているはずだ。実際、AIはそもそも、「PyTorch」や「TensorFlow」のようなオープンソースプログラムなしでは存在することができないからだ。今回のレポートはAIプロフェッショナル316人を調査対象としたもので、オープンソースと生成AIの大きな新トレンドを分析している。\n　平均では、生成AI利用者の41％が、AIをサポートしている自社のコードインフラストラクチャーはオープンソースだと回答している。生成AIの活用度が高い者になると、この割合は47％に上昇する。そして、「カーテンの裏側」にある、機械学習が大規模言語モデル（LLM）を生成するもともとの状況を見てみると、数字はさらに跳ね上がる。\n　これほど割合が高いのはなぜだろうか？　オープンソースの生成AIソリューションを選んだ理由としては、半数近く（46％）の企業が費用効率を挙げた。オープンソースツールなら、前払いのライセンス料を軽減でき、さらにプロプライエタリーなベンダーへの長期的な依存度も下げられる。たとえば、「LangChain」や「LlamaIndex」のようなAIアプリケーションフレームワークであれば、企業はプロプライエタリーなソリューションにかかる費用の何分の1かでAIモデルの開発や導入を行える。\n　もう1つのコスト削減要因としては、クラウドネイティブ技術を利用してスケーラブルな生成AIプログラムを実行するケースが増えてきた点が挙げられる。例を挙げると、「Kubernetes」は、スケーラブルな生成AIのワークロードを調整できる主要なツールとして台頭している。生成AIの推論作業の一部またはすべてのホスティングにこれを利用している企業は、全体の50％に達している。\n　また、回答者の半分強（52％）は、ソースコードの透明性と信頼性がオープンソースの生成AIソリューションを選んだ主な理由だと述べている。こうした性質を持つおかげで、企業はモデルの動作の確認や潜在的なバイアスの特定、法令の確実な順守が可能になる。\nこの記事は海外Ziff Davis発の記事を朝日インタラクティブが日本向けに編集したものです。\nZDNET Japan 記事を毎朝メールでまとめ読み(登録無料)\n「Windows 11 24H2」のインストールを避けるべき8つの理由--多数の不具合が発覚\n第1回：「責任あるAI」の構築を先導するのに欠かせないグローバルな視点\nマイクロソフト、クラウドPC「Windows 365 Link」を発表\n2025年は「Linux」飛躍の年--性能向上、新デスクトップ、市場シェアなどを予測\nシャドーITも見逃さない！複雑化する企業資産をさまざまな脅威から守る新たなアプローチ「EASM」とは\n情シスを悩ますセキュリティ対応と障害対応、ネットワーク構成を一元管理するポイントとは\nクラウドセキュリティ管理導入による投資収益率（ROI）は264％--米フォレスター調査レポート\n従来型のセキュリティでは太刀打ちできない「生成AIによるサイバー攻撃」撃退法のススメ\nマンガでわかる脆弱性“診断”と脆弱性“管理”の違い--セキュリティ体制の強化に脆弱性管理ツールの活用\n生成 AI 「Gemini」活用メリット、職種別・役職別のプロンプトも一挙に紹介\nマンガでわかる脆弱性“診断”と脆弱性“管理”の違い--セキュリティ体制の強化に脆弱性管理ツールの活用\nマンガで解説--企業に必要な「WAF」と「FW」の違い\nChatGPTに関連する詐欺が大幅に増加、パロアルトの調査結果に見るマルウェアの現状\n情報セキュリティに対する懸念を解消、「ISMS認証」取得の検討から審査当日までのTo Doリスト\n所属する組織のデータ活用状況はどの段階にありますか？\n\n      投票にはAsahi Interactive IDの登録・ログインが必要です\n    \nエンタープライズコンピューティングの最前線を配信\n\n      \n        ZDNET Japanは、CIOとITマネージャーを対象に、ビジネス課題の解決とITを活用した新たな価値創造を支援します。\n        ITビジネス全般については、CNET\n          Japanをご覧ください。\n      \n    \n\n        ZDNET Japanは、Ziff Davisからのライセンスに基づき朝日インタラクティブが運営しています。\n          ZDNET Japan is operated by Asahi Interactive under license from Ziff Davis.\n      \n\n        当サイトは最新ブラウザでの閲覧を推奨します。Copyright (c) 2024 ASAHI INTERACTIVE, Inc.

    "content": "Les dernières news\nLes entreprises qui utilisent des projets open-source comme Kubernetes sont de plus en plus souvent la cible de patent trolls. La communauté open source lance une contre-offensive. Et recherche des volontaires.\nPar Steven Vaughan-Nichols\n4 min\nKubeCon 2024 - Salt Lake City (Etats-Unis) - Si votre entreprise a récemment publié une offre d'emploi sur LinkedIn, vous avez peut-être reçu, en plus de l'afflux habituel de CV et de lettres de motivation, une réponse très inattendue : la menace d'un procès de la part de Edge Networking Systems LLC.\n\nEdge Networking est un \"patent troll\". Cela signifie qu'il achète des brevets, non pas pour les utiliser, mais pour extorquer de l'argent à quiconque voudrait utiliser le brevet.\nSupposons que vous ayez publié une offre d'emploi pour un ingénieur Kubernetes. Un robot de Edge s'en apercevra. Il supposera que vous utilisez Kubernetes. Et il vous enverra une note affirmant que vous violez son brevet Kubernetes. Et que vous devez lui payer des droits de licence. Bienvenue dans le monde merveilleux et sauvage des \"patent trolls\" !\nSelon l'Electronic Frontier Foundation, un \"patent troll utilise les brevets comme des armes juridiques, au lieu de créer de nouveaux produits ou de trouver de nouvelles idées\". Ils obtiennent leurs brevets pour quelques centimes de dollars de la part d'entreprises malchanceuses. Étant donné que l'Office américain des brevets et des marques (USPTO) accorde des brevets très larges pour des idées qui ne sont ni nouvelles ni révolutionnaires, il est facile pour un patent troll d'envoyer des lettres de menace à toute personne susceptible d'enfreindre ses brevets.\nCes lettres menacent généralement d'engager des poursuites judiciaires si le contrefacteur présumé n'accepte pas de payer une redevance de licence. Ces frais peuvent s'élever à des dizaines, voire des centaines de milliers de dollars.\nÉtant donné qu'il est beaucoup plus coûteux d'intenter une action en justice que de payer le troll, le \"patent trolling\" est un modèle commercial très fructueux. Plus de la moitié des procès en matière de brevets sont intentés par des trolls. Les entreprises qui utilisent des projets open-source, tels que Kubernetes, sont notamment de plus en plus souvent visées.\nLa Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), la Linux Foundation et United Patents en ont assez.\nLors de la KubeCon North America 2024 cette semaine, la directrice exécutive de la CNCF, Priyanka Sharma, a déclaré : \"Les patent troll ne contribuent pas à notre écosystème. Au lieu de cela, ils s'attaquent à ceux qui adoptent les technologies cloud natives en abusant du système juridique. Comme un troupeau de bœufs musqués, nous allons les chasser de notre pâturage\".\nChris Aniszczyk, directeur technique de la CNCF, a ajouté : \"La raison pour laquelle les trolls peuvent gagner de l'argent est que de nombreuses entreprises trouvent qu'il est trop coûteux de se défendre. Alors elles paient les trolls pour éviter le coût encore plus élevé d'un litige. Or, lorsque les entrprises s'unissent pour chasser un troll, la structure des coûts de la riposte s'en trouve modifiée. Cela perturbe leur modèle économique\".\nJim Zemlin, directeur exécutif de la Fondation Linux, a déclaré : \"Nous ne négocions pas avec les trolls. Nous travaillons avec des développeurs qui ont des antériorités, en attirant l'attention de l'USPTO sur ces antériorités et en tuant les brevets. Pas de négociation, pas de règlement. Nous détruisons l'actif même qui a permis aux patent troll de fonctionner. Nous avons pu, dans 90 % des cas, de détruire ces brevets\".\nS'il est important d'impliquer votre entreprise et son service juridique dans les efforts visant à repousser les patent trolls, les développeurs peuvent également apporter leur aide. La CNCF a annoncé le Cloud Native Heroes Challenge, un programme de bounty pour les patent troll dans lequel les développeurs et technologues cloud-native peuvent gagner des cadeaux et des prix.\nIls vous demandent de trouver des preuves de l'existence de technologies préexistantes - appelées \"antériorités\" par les avocats spécialisés dans les brevets - qui peuvent éliminer les mauvais brevets. Il peut s'agir de documentation open-source (y compris les notes de mise à jour), de normes ou de spécifications publiées, de manuels de produits, d'articles, de blogs, de livres ou de toute autre information accessible au public.\nTous les participants qui soumettent une entrée conforme aux règles du concours recevront un t-shirt gratuit \"Cloud Native Hero\" qu'ils pourront se procurer lors d'une prochaine KubeCon+CloudNativeCon. Le gagnant recevra également un prix de 3 000 dollars.\nDans le cadre de ce concours, la CNCF recherche des informations susceptibles d'être utilisées pour invalider la revendication 1 du brevet américain US-11695823-B1. Il s'agit du principal brevet revendiqué par Edge Networking Systems à l'encontre des utilisateurs de Kubernetes. Comme c'est souvent le cas avec de tels brevets, il est beaucoup trop large. Ce brevet décrit une architecture de réseau qui facilite une programmabilité sécurisée et flexible entre un appareil utilisateur et à travers un réseau avec une gestion complète du cycle de vie des services et des applications d'infrastructure. Cela décrit à peu près n'importe quel système de cloud computing.\nSi vous pouvez trouver des documents d'art antérieur décrivant un tel système avant le 13 juin 2013, vous pourriez être gagnant. Certains documents de ce type ont déjà été trouvés. Ce matériel est déjà répertorié dans l'onglet \"références connues\" de la page d'information du concours et ne remplit pas les conditions requises.\nSi vous tenez à ce que les logiciels libres restent faciles à utiliser et bon marché - ou si vous pensez que les trolls ne devraient pas être autorisés à profiter des entreprises qui fabriquent ou utilisent des programmes - vous pouvez aider. Je vais moi-même faire quelques recherches.\nSource : \"ZDNet.com\"\nL’éditeur français spécialiste de l’ITSM, EasyVista, prend une participation majoritaire dans son homologue allemand OTRS et s’ouvre les portes d’un marché en croissance de 720 millions de dollars en 2023.\nAprès 18 mois, NumSpot et ses actionnaires font le bilan, se félicitant de la maturité et des attentes des clients à l’égard du cloud souverain.

De Veaugh-Geiss, community manager del progetto KDE Eco di KDE e.V. Che in occasione di SFSCON 2024 terr\ufffd una sessione su come utilizzare software open source per dare nuova vita a vecchi computer                             \nL’8 e il 9 novembre NOI Techpark, il parco scientifico tecnologico di Bolzano, ospiterà la South Tyrol Free Software Conference (SFSCON), un evento interamente dedicato al free software e aperto al pubblico. Una manifestazione che Edge9 segue dal 2019 e alla quale parteciperà anche quest’anno, non solo in qualità di testata giornalistica, ma anche con la moderazione di una delle track, che sarà affidata a Vittorio Manti. Numerosissimi gli interventi che si susseguiranno nei due giorni, fra cui quello di Joseph P. De Veaugh-Geiss, community manager del progetto KDE Eco di KDE e.V., l’associazione no-profit che rappresenta il progetto KDE relativamente agli aspetti finanziari e legali.\nIn occasione di SFSCON 2024, De Veaugh-Geiss farà una presentazione intitolata “Opt out? Opt in? Opt Green! Bringing Free Software To Eco-Consumers” dove parlerà dell’iniziativa OptGreen di KDE Eco. Abbiamo avuto modo di intervistarlo per avere qualche anticipazione su quello che presenterà.\nChi vuole approfondire il discorso potrà seguire la presentazione di De Veaugh-Geiss l’8 novembre, al NOI Techpark, alle 11:20, nell’ambito di SFSCON 2024. Il programma della due giorni, fittissimo di eventi, è disponibile a questo indirizzo.\nKDE Eco è un’iniziativa avviata nel 2021 che si pone l’obiettivo di implementare e sensibilizzare sui criteri del Blue Angel per certificare il software per desktop dal punto di vista dell’impatto ambientale. Con “criteri allineati ai valori del mondo free software”, spiega De Veaugh-Geiss, quindi trasparenza e autonomia. Fra le prime iniziative il progetto Blue Angel for Foss, che aveva lo scopo di far partire la discussione sul tema della certificazione ambientale del software, raccogliendo i feedback dei portatori di interesse sui criteri di sostenibilità scelti e su come applicarli al mondo del free software.\n\nA due anni dal lancio, questo progetto è stato chiuso e si è evoluto in OptGreen, Sustainable Software for Sustainable Hardware. “L’idea è quella di utilizzare i criteri Blue Angel [la prima Eco label al mondo, nata in Germania NdR] come benchmark e incoraggiare l’utilizzo a lungo termine dell’hardware, appoggiandosi al free software”, afferma De Veaugh-Geiss. Il concetto è semplice da comprendere: oggi molti dispositivi perfettamente funzionanti sono sostituiti o rimangono inutilizzati perché nuove versioni del software li rendono obsoleti. Pensiamo ai tanti computer che non possiedono i requisiti per installare Windows 10/11: in molti casi, sono sufficientemente potenti per una serie di operazioni, come il lavoro da ufficio, la navigazione web, l’utilizzo di servizi online. Il fatto che Microsoft abbia abbandonato il supporto a Windows 7 (e a ottobre 2025 anche quello per Windows 19), però, significa che queste macchine non vengono più aggiornate con patch di sicurezza. In pratica, sono vulnerabili a una serie di attacchi informatici.\nSostituire macchine perfettamente funzionanti solo per via del software obsoleto, però, è uno spreco in termini energetici, che porta a emettere tonnellate di CO2 in ambiente che potrebbero essere evitate semplicemente sfruttando software open source. Tipicamente, una delle distribuzioni del sistema operativo Linux.\nDe Veaugh-Geiss fa il paragone con il diritto alla riparazione, recentemente stabilito anche dalle norme UE: poter installare il software che si desidera, e modificarlo adeguandolo alle proprie necessità grazie alla disponibilità dei sorgenti, in ottica open source, permette a tutti gli effetti di aumentare il ciclo di vita dei dispositivi hardware, contribuendo alla riduzione dei rifiuti elettronici, che sono tra l’altro molto inquinanti e difficili da smaltire adeguatamente.\nIn altre parole, si tratta di quella “device neutrality” che, per esempio, ha dato origine a progetti di una certa rilevanza della Free Software Foundation Europe, come si può leggere qui.\nSe da un lato evitare di gettare in discarica il vecchio hardware e continuare a utilizzarlo è un beneficio per l’ambiente, c’è anche da dire che il nuovo hardware è solitamente più efficiente dal punto di vista energetico, ed è quindi in grado di svolgere le stesse operazioni consumando meno energia. E qui si pone un dilemma: dove si trova il giusto equilibrio? Una considerazione che fa De Veaugh-Geiss è quella delle emissioni di CO2 associate alla produzione di nuovo hardware: sono talmente elevate che raramente la maggiore efficienza giustifica la sostituzione, per lo meno dal punto di vista dell’impatto sull’ambiente.\n\n“C’è uno studio di un’Università svizzera che prende in esame proprio le emissioni associate alla produzione di nuovi dispositivi: oltre il 75% delle emissioni nel ciclo di vita completo è dovuto alla produzione”, non al suo utilizzo. Insomma, la quantità di CO2 generata durante la produzione è enormemente superiore a quella generata dall’utilizzo, nell’ambito ICT. Secondo altri studi citati da De Veaugh-Geiss, fra cui uno condotto dalla German Environment Agency (in tedesco), se anche si avesse un miglioramento dell’efficienza energetica del 10% ogni anno, sarebbero comunque necessari 30 anni prima che abbia senso dismettere completamente un dispositivo, sempre parlando in termini di impatto ambientale. Insomma, tirando le somme, anche se è vero che l’efficienza dell’hardware è in continuo miglioramento, allo stesso tempo i costi energetici associati alla produzione aumentano significativamente.\nIn passato, non era facilissimo sostituire Windows con Linux. Se infatti l’installazione è da tempo cosa alla portata di tutti, non sempre è stato facile trovare alternative alle applicazioni usate ogni giorno. E non sempre le periferiche sono supportate.\n\nOggi Linux è però molto più maturo: le periferiche più comune (stampanti, schede video, schede audio) sono supportate nativamente, senza bisogno di installare manualmente i driver. E non mancano alternative open source ai programmi più utilizzati in ambito domestico e lavorativo. “I miei genitori sono passati a Linux circa 5 anni fa, quando Microsoft ha cessato il supporto per Windows 7”, spiega De Veaugh-Geiss, sottolineando che non hanno mai avuto serie difficoltà. Ogni tanto, parliamo di una volta ogni due o tre anni, De Veaugh-Geiss afferma di essere intervenuto per supportarli con operazioni che chiedevano di aprire un terminale e scrivere qualche stringa, ma niente di particolarmente complesso. Certo, non mancano casi dove l’assenza dei driver per Linux pone ostacoli insormontabili, obbligando a tutti gli effetti a dotarsi di nuovo hardware, ma parliamo di situazioni rare.\nUn ultimo tema che vale la pena sottolineare è come le iniziative per il software “eco” si sposino alla perfezione con altre, già avviate in Germania, per aiutare le persone a riparare i propri dispositivi. In varie città tedesche, infatti, vengono organizzati workshop aperti al pubblico per spiegare come riparare dispositivi elettronici, da vecchi computer a smartphone, tablet e via dicendo. Il focus sul software, alla fine, è un ulteriore stimolo a utilizzare questi dispositivi con qualche anno di età perché, come detto all’inizio, inutile avere dell’hardware in perfette condizioni se poi il software non lo supporta più. Sotto questo profilo, l’open source è un modo per estendere a lungo la vita di quei tanti dispositivi che spesso rimangono in cantina inutilizzati, anche se potrebbero tornare a funzionare bene con piccoli, semplici interventi.\nSFSCON è cofinanziata dall’UE nell’ambito del progetto FESR 1048 IMPACT.\n",

    "content": "Posted on November 21, 2024  by Steven P. Sanderson II, MPH  in R bloggers | 0 Comments\nAre you new to Linux and looking to learn the basics of text editing? Look no further than VI (or VIM), the ubiquitous text editor that comes pre-installed on nearly every Linux distribution. While it may seem intimidating at first with its unique modal editing style, VI is a powerful tool that is well worth learning. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll walk you through the fundamentals of using VI to edit text files on Linux systems.\nVI, which stands for “Visual Editor”, is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. Today, it is available on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems. VI is known for its modal editing, where the meaning of typed keys depends on which mode the editor is in.\nThe original VI was developed by Bill Joy in 1976 as the visual mode for a line editor called EX. It has since been replaced by an improved version called VIM (VI Improved), which adds many useful features while maintaining backwards compatibility with the original VI.\nYou may be wondering, with modern graphical text editors and IDEs available, why bother learning an old, terminal-based editor like VI? Here are a few compelling reasons:\nVI is installed by default on virtually all Linux and Unix-based systems. Knowing the basics will allow you to edit text files on any system you log into.\nVI is lightweight and fast, making it ideal for quick edits without the overhead of a graphical editor.\nMany common Linux tools like less and man use VI-style key bindings, so familiarity with VI will make you more proficient on the command line overall.\nMastering VI will greatly improve your speed and efficiency when editing code and configuration files.\nVI has an extensive ecosystem of plugins and customizations that cater to specific editing needs, from syntax highlighting to version control integration.\nTo launch VI, simply open a terminal and type vi followed by the name of the file you want to edit (or create):\nIf the specified file does not exist, VI will create a new blank file. If no filename is given, VI will open with an empty untitled document.\nOne of the first things to understand about VI is its concept of modes. When you open a file in VI, you start in command mode, where typed keys are interpreted as commands that control the editor. To enter text, you must switch to insert mode. Let’s look at the three main modes:\nWhen you first open VI, you are in command mode. In this mode, every key is a command that performs a specific action, such as navigating through the document, deleting text, or changing options. For example:\nTo enter text into the document, you need to switch to insert mode. Press i to enter insert mode at the cursor position. Now any keys you type will be inserted into the document at the cursor position. To return to command mode, press Esc.\nThere are a few other ways to enter insert mode:\nVisual mode allows you to visually select text in the document for manipulation. Press v to enter visual mode, then use the arrow keys or VI movement commands to select text. Once selected, you can perform operations on the highlighted text, such as:\nPress Esc to exit visual mode and return to command mode.\nNow that you understand VI’s modal editing system, let’s look at some basic editing tasks.\nIn command mode, you can navigate through the document using the arrow keys or these “HJKL” keys:\nYou can precede these movements with a number to move faster:\nThere are also some bigger movement commands:\nFrom command mode:\nTo save your changes, type :w in command mode and press Enter. To quit VI, type :q and press Enter. If you have unsaved changes, VI will warn you and refuse to quit. To discard your changes and quit anyway, use :q!. To save and quit in one command, type :wq.\nNow that you’ve learned the basics of VI, it’s time to practice! Open a new file in VI and try out the following:\nHere’s a sample text you can use:\nOpen a new file in VI by typing vi test_file.txt in your terminal.\nPress i to enter insert mode and type the sample text:\nPress Esc to return to command mode.\nUse h, j, k, l or arrow keys to move the cursor around the text. Make some edits, such as changing “jumps” to “leaps” in the first line.\nMove the cursor to the second line and press yy to yank (copy) the line.\nMove the cursor to the end of the file and press p to paste the yanked line.\nTo save the changes, type :w in command mode and press Enter.\nTo quit VI, type :q and press Enter.\nCongratulations, you’ve just completed your first VI editing session! With practice, these commands will become second nature, and you’ll be able to efficiently navigate and edit text files in any Unix-based environment.\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.spsanderson.com/steveondata/posts/2024-11-22/todays_post.png?w=578\u0026#038;ssl=1\" class=\"img-fluid figure-img\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\nCongratulations, you now know the basics of using the VI editor on Linux! While it takes some practice to master the key commands and modal editing style, the effort you put in will pay off in your future Linux endeavors. VI is an indispensable tool for system administrators, developers, and power users.\nTo further hone your skills, spend some time each day editing files in VI. You’ll be surprised how quickly the key bindings will become second nature. As you gain proficiency, you can explore VI’s more advanced features like macros, split windows, and customizing your configuration.\nQ: What is the difference between VI and VIM?\nA: VIM is an enhanced version of the original VI editor, with additional features and customization options. However, VIM maintains backwards compatibility with VI, so the core functionality is the same.\nQ: Can I use the mouse in VI?\nA: VI was designed for a mouse-free workflow, so it relies on keyboard commands for all navigation and editing tasks. However, some modern versions of VIM do include mouse support as an optional feature.\nQ: How can I customize VI to my liking?\nA: VI looks for a configuration file called .vimrc in your home directory. Here you can set your preferred options, define custom key mappings, and more. See the VIM documentation for a full list of available settings.\nQ: Is it worth learning VI if I already use a graphical editor?\nA: Absolutely! VI is a fundamental tool that every Linux user should know. Not only is it ubiquitous across all Unix-like systems, but mastering VI will also make you more efficient in terminal-based workflows. That said, there’s nothing wrong with using a graphical editor when it makes sense.\nQ: Can I use VI to edit code with syntax highlighting?\nA: Yes, VIM has excellent support for syntax highlighting for hundreds of programming languages and file formats. It also has features like code folding, auto-indentation, and plugins for specific languages and frameworks.\nI hope this gentle introduction to VI has piqued your interest and encouraged you to explore this classic Linux tool. Stick with it, and you’ll be editing like a pro in no time!

    "content": "Posted on November 7, 2024  by Steven P. Sanderson II, MPH  in R bloggers | 0 Comments\nLinux, an open-source operating system known for its stability and flexibility, relies heavily on efficient process management. For beginners venturing into the world of Linux, understanding processes and mastering related commands is crucial for effective system administration and troubleshooting. This comprehensive guide will explore Linux processes, their management, and essential commands like ps, top, jobs, and bg, tailored specifically for newcomers to the Linux ecosystem.\nIn the Linux operating system, a process is defined as a program in execution. It represents an instance of a running program, encompassing both the program code and its current activity. Each process in Linux is assigned a unique Process ID (PID), which allows the operating system to manage and track it effectively.\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/In_flight_system_Linux_bootup_flat.jpg/500px-In_flight_system_Linux_bootup_flat.jpg?w=578\u0026#038;ssl=1\" class=\"img-fluid figure-img\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\nImage: Linux bootup process, showcasing the initialization of various processes\nLinux processes can be broadly categorized into two main types:\nForeground Processes: These are interactive processes that require user input and are executed in the foreground. They are directly associated with a terminal and can be managed using job control commands. Foreground processes typically occupy the terminal until they complete or are manually suspended.\nBackground Processes: These processes run independently of user interaction and are often used for system services and long-running tasks. Background processes can be initiated by appending the \u0026 symbol at the end of a command or by using the nohup command to ensure they continue running even after the user logs out.\nThroughout its lifecycle, a Linux process can transition through several states:\nUnderstanding these states is crucial for effective process management and troubleshooting system issues.\nFor beginner Linux users, mastering a few key commands is essential for efficient process management. Let’s explore the functionality and usage of four fundamental commands: ps, top, jobs, and bg.\nThe ps command, short for “process status,” is used to display information about currently running processes on a Linux system. It provides a snapshot of the processes at the time the command is executed.\nThis basic command will show processes associated with the current terminal session. For a more comprehensive view, you can use options like:\nFor example, to see all processes with detailed information:\nThis command is particularly useful for identifying resource-intensive processes or troubleshooting system issues.\nThe top command is an interactive tool that provides a real-time view of the system’s processes. It displays system resource usage, including CPU and memory, and allows users to manage processes directly from the interface.\nWhen you run top, you’ll see a dynamic list of processes that updates regularly. The output includes:\nYou can interact with the top interface using various keyboard commands:\nThe top command is invaluable for monitoring system performance and identifying processes that may be consuming excessive resources.\nThe jobs command is used to list the jobs that are running in the background or have been stopped in the current shell session. It’s particularly useful for managing processes that have been started from the terminal.\nThis command will display a list of all jobs with their statuses (running, stopped, etc.). You can use additional options for more specific information:\nThe jobs command is essential for keeping track of background processes and managing multiple tasks simultaneously.\nThe bg command is used to resume a suspended job in the background. This is particularly useful when a process has been stopped (e.g., using Ctrl+Z) and you want it to continue running without occupying the terminal.\nAfter suspending a job with Ctrl+Z, you can use bg followed by the job ID (which you can find using the jobs command) to resume it in the background. This allows for multitasking by letting users continue working on other tasks while the background job runs.\nAs a beginner Linux user, developing effective process management strategies is crucial. Here are some tips to help you get started:\nRegularly Monitor System Resources: Use commands like top or htop to keep an eye on CPU and memory usage. This helps you identify resource-intensive processes that might be affecting system performance.\nLearn to Interpret Process Information: Understanding the output of commands like ps and top is essential. Pay attention to metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and process states.\nPractice Using Background Processes: Experiment with running commands in the background using the \u0026 symbol or the bg command. This skill is valuable for managing long-running tasks efficiently.\nFamiliarize Yourself with Job Control: Get comfortable with using jobs, fg (foreground), and bg commands to manage processes in your terminal sessions.\nUnderstand Process Priorities: Learn about process priorities and how to adjust them using commands like nice and renice. This can help you optimize system performance.\nBe Cautious with Terminating Processes: Before killing a process, especially system processes, make sure you understand its role. Terminating critical processes can lead to system instability.\nExplore Additional Tools: As you become more comfortable, explore advanced tools like htop, atop, and pstree for more detailed process management.\nTo help you better understand Linux processes and related commands, here are some frequently asked questions:\nWhat is a process in Linux? A process in Linux is an executing instance of a program. It’s a fundamental concept that allows the operating system to perform multitasking by running multiple processes simultaneously. Each process is assigned a unique Process ID (PID).\nHow can I list running processes in Linux? You can list running processes using several commands:\nWhat is the difference between ps and top commands?\nHow do you use the jobs command in Linux? The jobs command lists all jobs that you have started in the current shell session. It shows the job ID, status, and command associated with each job. This is useful for managing background and suspended jobs.\nHow can I send a process to the background using the bg command? To send a process to the background, first suspend it using Ctrl+Z, then type bg to resume it in the background. This allows you to continue using the terminal while the process runs.\nNow that you’ve learned about Linux processes and essential commands, let’s put your knowledge to the test with a practical exercise.\nProblem: Create a simple shell script that runs a long process in the background, checks its status, and then terminates it.\nTry to write the script yourself before looking at the solution below. This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of background processes, the jobs command, and process termination.\nThis script does the following: 1. Starts a sleep 300 command in the background (simulating a long-running process). 2. Captures the PID of the background process. 3. Uses the jobs command to check the status of background jobs. 4. Waits for 5 seconds. 5. Terminates the process using the kill command. 6. Checks the job status again to confirm termination.\nTry running this script and observe how the process is managed in the background!\nUnderstanding Linux processes and mastering commands like ps, top, jobs, and bg is fundamental for effective system management and troubleshooting. As a beginner, regular practice with these commands will enhance your ability to navigate the Linux environment confidently. Remember, process management is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of more advanced Linux system administration tasks.\nBy following this guide and consistently applying these concepts, you’ll be well on your way to becoming proficient in Linux process management. As you continue your Linux journey, don’t hesitate to explore more advanced topics and tools to further enhance your skills in this powerful and versatile operating system.\nWe value your input and experiences!

Increase the incompetence, you get fewer bugs!  Problem solved.\nI can't wait to hear all the arguments to apply GPLv3 to cars, those dirty corporations TiVoizing their cars to deny you your freedumbs.  Also, a continuous stream of exploits as OSS \"Automotive Grade\" codebases are compromised and then adopted, kind of like what's been experienced with Tesla already.\nAll this amounts to is an effort to convert cars to same mile-high pile of shit s \n\nSo we're going to take the questionable engineering skills of people like Jeep/Fiat and Ford, and apply them to open source software??\nPardon me while I go tune up my bicycle.\nWe're going to take an industry where quality management means people don't die and apply Linus Torvald's system of project management by throwing a tantrum?There will be tears, but they won't be caused by the automotive side.\nOpen Source is used everywhere, the only part this is talking about is the kernel itself.\nMy cynical view is that the car manufacturer will conveniently stop producing the electronics, so you'll struggle to find replacement components that burn out without replacing the whole damned ECU and centre console. Pretty much writing the car off because a small irreplaceable component fails.\nLinux has damned good backward compatibility, but not always forward compatible, and that's where I think the manufacturers wil \n\"The rise of software-defined vehicles has led to a growing trend of automakers not just using, but also contributing, to open source software.\"\nThere is no such thing as a software-defined vehicle.  Whoever said this doesn't know what that term means.\nCars have been dominated by software for a long, long time.  What has changed are only the human interface portions, mostly for the worse.  Android is used in a number of cars now, that's already Linux as far as Linux goes.  \"Automotive Grade\" means nothing, it \n\nAndroid is used in a number of cars now, that's already Linux as far as Linux goes.\nNot really. Linux merely hosts Android. Android itself is a complete OS from the programmer's perspective. Linux a behind the scenes implementation detail.\n\nNot really. Linux merely hosts Android. Android itself is a complete OS from the programmer's perspective. Linux a behind the scenes implementation detail.\nMy Sparc server has Linux on an internal card that does system checks before it hands off the boot to Solaris.\n\nWhat has changed are only the human interface portions\n That's really not true. The level and sophistication of the backend compute in vehicles has increased drastically in the past decade. Most new cars are running on systems with a hypervisor at their core (such as https://www.visteon.com/produc... [visteon.com] or https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/... [qnx.com]). Control modules have gotten more powerful as more systems go electronic. I bought a new truck in 2022 to replace my 2008 and the differences are startling. Steering, e-brake, 4wd are all electronic or electronic assisted now. The car's computer can control basically everything. It can steer by itself (lane assist), apply brakes (emergency braking, brake hold), apply the ebrake by itself, shift to park by itself (if you open the door when it's stopped and not in park it will set the ebrake and shift into park), change transmission shift points (performance mode/eco mode/tow mode/etc), and on and on. All that on what is one model above base.\n\nThere is no such thing as a software-defined vehicle. Whoever said this doesn't know what that term means.\n Seems pretty prevalent in the industry.

I'm going to assume they know more that you on the subject, unless you can provide some credentials to prove otherwise:\nI'm in the industry, along with several friends and family members, directly and indirectly.\nIt's so much of a thing that AIAG is changing how the standardized product procurement and quality guidelines are defined to include software testing and quality assurance.\nThe tl;dr version of what it means is that car companies can push newly developed features to cars after they are sold via software updates. It may not seem like a big deal, but it's a *radical* departure from the existing product development cycle, which is long and complicated. For reference, a complete type acceptance cycle for a new platform can take two or three years. A new drivetrain could six years.\n\nThe tl;dr version of what it means is that car companies can push newly developed features to cars after they are sold via software updates.\n\nBecause that's what everyone wants on the road: An incomplete, glitch-filled, rushed-out-to-meet-management's-deadlines, car with Day-1 DLC, subscription pricing, and multi gigabyte update patches weighing in over a few tons, and moving down the road at 75 MPh.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the driver yet.....\n\nBecause that's what everyone wants on the road:\nThat's how Tesla does it, and the only non-truck that sells better than the Model Y is the RAV-4. So, yeah, people are buying the heck out of software-defined cars.\n...but I sure as hell don't want an Agile car!\n\nThere is no such thing as a software-defined vehicle.  Whoever said this doesn't know what that term means.\nHere's more if you want to learn about SDV:\nhttps://www.bosch-mobility.com... [bosch-mobility.com]\nSoftware defined vehicle: take away the software and it's not a vehicle anymore. Contrast with a software-free vehicle which does not require 15k lines of code for the engine to turn over and 20k lines of code to apply the brakes.\nA free-software vehicle, btw, would be similar to a software defined vehicle except it's double or triple the lines of code and they're all copy-pasted python from stackoverflow.\n\"Automotive Grade\" means nothing, it's just branding for a grift.\nIt isn't. Right now, Linux is only good enough for non-critical parts of the car - which basically limits it to the infotainment system.\nAll the other parts are running under a safety critical OS, with Linux/Android running in a VM on QNX, for example.\nAutomotive grade means Linux gets to graduate from untrusted to Quality Managed on the ASIL ratings, and maybe even higher. This means it's not good enough for safety critical things like the dash \n\"Automotive Grade\" fills me with the same existential dread as \"Military Grade\".  i.e. built by the lowest bidder whose primary expertise is NOT manufacturing product XYZ, but is in fact the ability to navigate bureaucracy, with actual manufacturing, engineering, or design ability FAR down on their list of competencies if present at all.\nISS Astronauts are Safe.  But NASA and Russia Disagree on How to Fix Leak\nDoes Casio's New Calculator Watch Take You Back To 6th Grade Math Class?\nThe reason that every major university maintains a department of\nmathematics is that it's cheaper than institutionalizing all those people.\n",

(Ver)\nEste Compromiso es un intento de abordar un problema que ha existido durante mucho tiempo dentro del ecosistema de código abierto. Muchas empresas han construido sus negocios sobre software de código abierto, beneficiándose de las contribuciones de los mantenedores que las dan por sentado.

    "content": "The merger of two popular open-source communities could sharpen the focus on bolstering online privacy and web-surfing anonymity.\nThe Amnesic Incognito Live System, or Tails, and the anonymity network Tor Project, short for The Onion Router, announced in late September a merger to unite operations and resources from both software communities into a single entity. The merger started in late 2023 when the Tails leadership needed a solution to having maxed out operational funds. Both entities decided to share the common goal of online anonymity.\nA joint statement explained that the merger solved expansion and operational issues for both parties. Tails developers could avoid independently expanding operational capacity by combining with the Tor Project’s “larger and established operational framework.”\n“By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project,” according to the announcement.\nThe merger is significant as it unifies two similar projects, enhancing resources and efficiency in developing robust online privacy tools, according to Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, a comprehensive certificate lifecycle management firm. He views this merger as substantially impacting privacy concerns by improving tools that better protect users from surveillance and data misuse.\n“Increased focus on internet privacy is essential, and open-source projects should lead in providing transparent, collaborative solutions to safeguard personal data,” he told LinuxInsider.\nTor and Tails are most often used together, noted Soroko. Tails is a live Linux operating system that routes all internet traffic through the Tor network by default. Tor routes traffic through multiple volunteer-operated nodes, making it much harder to trace.\nTails, a free live operating system, ensures that no data is stored on the device after use, providing a secure environment that leaves no traces. This security measure is essential for users in high-risk situations, such as journalists, activists, or whistleblowers who need to protect their identities and activities from surveillance and censorship, he explained.\nBoth organizations aim to protect users from surveillance and censorship over the internet. Tails already used the Tor network to enhance online privacy. The free Tor browser, a tool frequently used to navigate the dark web, remains hidden from visited websites to avoid third-party trackers and ads.\nTor is an independent web browser that connects users to the internet through a proxy server, enabling anonymous connections from IP addresses that cannot be linked to a specific service or individual.\nCasey Ellis, founder and advisor at crowdsourced cybersecurity firm Bugcrowd, agreed that this is an interesting move that makes a lot of sense. Sharing the business infrastructure will free up the Tails team, and the core group will have the time and opportunity to focus on the evolving needs of a privacy-focused OS like Tails.\n“This merger involving an operating system such as Tails was long-awaited … Hopefully, this move broadens awareness of and contribution to the maintenance and improvement of both projects,” he told LinuxInsider.\nIn enterprises that approve web traffic monitoring for security and use of unapproved software and operating systems, this definitely will have privacy concerns. However, for legitimate and privacy-focused users, this will be a boon, offered Mayuresh Dani, manager of security research for the Threat Research Unit at Qualys.\n“Protection against the abuse of personal data should definitely be one of the topmost pillars in protecting enterprises,” he told LinuxInsider.\nIn today’s interconnected world, everyone has an app for everything. All these apps share data with their creators as analytics to improve their services or products.\n“Most of us are not aware of the information being collected at all. If a threat actor gains access to this personalized information, then a lot of attacks are possible,” he added.\nGrowing concerns about internet data abuse are impacting both consumers and enterprises, suggested Arjun Bhatnagar, co-founder and CEO of privacy company Cloaked.\n“The demand for privacy as a response to a growing abuse of personal data is rapidly becoming one of the most important issues of our time,” he told LinuxInsider.\nStrong interest is mounting in understanding how to tackle the abuse of data. This is prevalent with consumers actively disengaging by deactivating online accounts to businesses facing potential bankruptcy (e.g., 23andMe) due to reputation loss after a data breach.\nThis growing privacy concern is rooted in high-profile data breaches, manipulative AI algorithms, misuse of data for targeted advertising, unethical data-sharing practices, and intrusive surveillance by governments and corporations, which are entering daily discourse among individuals, Bhatnagar detailed.\nHe agreed that the merger, by uniting two trusted privacy tools, could strengthen efforts to protect users from surveillance and data exploitation.\n“With shared resources, the merged entity can offer an integrated, more robust defense against surveillance and data abuse,” he said.\nAccording to Bhatnagar, the privacy focus should be on ensuring transparency, accountability, and robust security practices, regardless of the model. As privacy threats increase, both open-source and proprietary solutions must commit to prioritizing user data protection.\n“Ultimately, the priority should be creating solutions that empower users to maintain control over their data while minimizing the risks of exploitation and abuse,” he urged.\nWhile some in the business and technology industries push for software developers to take an active role in safeguarding online privacy, others in the software development field argue that resolving the abuse of personal data on the internet is above their pay grade.\nDecisions about personal data collection are typically made by product managers, who determine what data to collect, guided by relevant laws and guidelines.\nHowever, they are incentivized to collect as much as possible, argued Brian Behlendorf, a technologist, computer programmer, and leading figure in the open-source software movement. He also is the general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF).\n“Other business roles inside a typical company decide with whom and how to share data and then direct engineers to implement,” he told LinuxInsider.\nBehlendorf argued that, in most cases, software developers are not usually empowered to create software that minimizes the collection or sharing of personal data. Their convictions about this might not outweigh their employers’ designs and mandates; he offered as a personal opinion.\nHe emphasized that his comments do not represent OSSF (which is hosted by The Linux Foundation) nor affiliations with Mozilla or the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\n“On a personal level, software developers I know are as angry as average citizens are about the ways their data is being used today,” Behlendorf continued.\nDevelopers are even more sensitive to what happens beneath the user interface layer and the potential for that abuse, he added.\nTor helps ensure your web traffic is difficult for anyone, including nation-state actors, to trace. Tails helps lock down your local computing environment in ways that make it difficult for even government-sponsored actors to hack.\nBehlendorf noted that these are tools that average consumers could use, and the more consumer usage they get, the better. The most compelling use cases are for users engaged in sensitive work.\nPeople in the human rights and journalism communities already know about Tor, but a much smaller number know about Tails.\n“Hopefully, this merger helps that crowd with intense needs also start to use Tails and benefit from its security promises and reassures them that the organizations behind these two pieces are better resourced,” he offered.\n“More broadly, among the consumer public, I don’t see as much impact, though I hope it creates positive pressure among the more popular social network apps to be more secure by default.”\nJack M.

Y tuvo sus origenes en diciembre de 2020, cuando Red Hat anunció que descontinuaría el desarrollo de CentOS, que había sido una versión downstream lista para producción de Red Hat Enterprise Linux, a favor de una variante de desarrollo upstream más nueva de ese sistema operativo conocida como «CentOS Stream». Lo que origino que, el fundador original de CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer, anunciara la creación de un proyecto para lograr los objetivos originales de CentOS, bajo el nombre de Rocky Linux, en honor al cofundador de CentOS, Rocky McGaugh. Sobre Rocky Linux\nY para no dejar ninguna por fuera, vale mencionar también el anuncio oficial de otros conocidos lanzamientos de Distros GNU/Linux durante este periodo de tiempo:\n\n\n\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux.jpeg\" alt=\"Imagen de Resumen para post 2024\" width=\"1200\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux.jpeg 1200w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-420x71.jpeg 420w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-600x101.jpeg 600w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-768x129.jpeg 768w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-400x67.jpeg 400w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-500x84.jpeg 500w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-840x141.jpeg 840w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-1024x172.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.desdelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/midori-11-2-novedades-imagen-resumen-blog-desdelinux-150x25.jpeg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 860px\"/\u003e\n\n\nEn resumen, esperamos que esta cuadragésima séptima publicación (semana 47) de esta serie dedicada a las «Novedades de las Distros del Linuxverso para cada semana del año 2024» te haya gustado y sido útil, informativa y técnicamente.

    "content": "Not all Linux distributions provide platforms for enterprise and non-business adopters. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and the Fedora Project let users keep their Linux computing all in the family.\nBoth the enterprise and community versions have upgraded over the last few weeks. RHEL is a commercial distribution available through a subscription and does not rely solely on community support. On the other hand, Fedora Linux is a free distro supported and maintained by the open-source community. In this case, Red Hat is the Fedora Project’s primary sponsor.\nHowever, independent developers in the Fedora community also contribute to the project. Often, Fedora Linux is a proving ground for new features that ultimately become part of the RHEL operating system.\nWhile Fedora caters to developers and enthusiasts, RHEL focuses on delivering enterprise-grade solutions. What’s the difference? Each edition caters to the needs of users’ business or consumer goals. Of course, using Fedora comes at a great price: it is free to download.\nOn Nov. 13, Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 with improved functionality in deploying applications and more effectively managing workloads across hybrid clouds while mitigating IT risks from the data center to public clouds to the edge. Matt Miller, the Fedora Linux project leader, announced the release of Fedora 41 on Oct. 29.\nAccording to global market intelligence firm IDC, organizations struggle to strike a balance between maintaining their Linux operating system environments and their workloads, which are hampered by time and resource constraints. The proliferation of the cloud and next-generation workloads such as AI and ML worsen their computing productivity.\nRHEL standardization increased the agility of IT infrastructure administration management teams by consolidating OSes, automating highly manual tasks such as scaling and provisioning, and decreasing the complexity of deployments. As a result, infrastructure teams spent 26% more time on business and infrastructure innovation, Red Hat noted.\nRHEL 9.5 delivers enhanced capabilities to bring more consistency to the operating system underpinning rapid IT innovations. This impacts the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in edge computing to make these booming advancements an accessible reality for more organizations.\nEnterprise IT complexity is growing exponentially, fueled by the rapid adoption of new technologies like AI. This growth affects both the applications Red Hat develops and the environments in which they operate, according to Gunnar Hellekson, VP and GM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n“While more complexity can impact the attack surface, we are committed to making Red Hat Enterprise Linux the most secure, zero-trust platform on the market so businesses can tackle each challenge head-on with a secure base at the most fundamental levels of a system. This commitment enables the business to embrace the next wave of technology innovations,” he told LinuxInsider.\nThe release includes a collection of Red Hat Ansible Content subscriptions that automate everyday administrative tasks at scale. The latest version also adds several new system roles, including a new role for sudo, a command-line utility in Linux, to automate the configuration of sudo at scale.\nBy leveraging this capability, users can execute commands typically reserved for administrators while proper guardrails ensure rules are managed effectively. With automation, users with elevated privileges can implement sudo configurations securely and consistently across their environments, helping organizations reduce complexity and improve operational efficiency.\nIncreased platform support for confidential computing enables data protection for AI workloads and lowers the attack surface for insider threats. By preventing potential threats from viewing or tampering with sensitive data, confidential computing allows enterprises to have more opportunities to use AI more securely to review large amounts of data while still maintaining data segmentation and adhering to data compliance regulations.\nThe Image Builder feature advances a “shift left” approach by integrating security testing and vulnerability fixes earlier in the development cycle. This methodology delivers pre-hardened image configurations to customers, enhancing security while reducing setup time. The benefit of these built-in capabilities is the ability to configure without being security experts.\nManagement tools simplify system administration. Users can automate manual tasks, standardize deployment at scale, and reduce system complexities.\nNew file management capabilities in the web console allow routine file management tasks without using the command line, simplifying actions such as browsing the file system, uploading and downloading files, changing permissions, and creating directories.\nAnother benefit addresses cloud computing storage. Container-native innovation at the platform level fully supports Podman 5.0, the latest version of the open-source container engine. It gives developers a powerful tool for building, managing, and running containers in Linux environments.\nAccording to Greg Macatee, research manager for infrastructure software platforms and worldwide infrastructure research at IDC, companies using the new RHEL release validated that the platform simplified management while reducing overall system complexity.\n“They also noted that it radically reduced the time required for patching while simplifying kernel modifications and centralizing policy controls. They further called out the value of automation, better scalability, and access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux expertise,” he told LinuxInsider.\nApplication streams provide the latest curated developer tools, languages, and databases needed to fuel innovative applications. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 includes PG Vector for PostgreSQL, new versions of node.js, GCC toolset, Rust toolset, and LLVM toolset.\nWhile Java Dev Kit (JDK) 11 reached its end of maintenance in RHEL 9, this new release continues supporting customers using it. The new default JDK 17 brings new features and tools for building and managing modern Java applications while maintaining backward compatibility to keep JDK upgrades consistent for applications and users.\nThe Fedora Project calls its community operating system Fedora Workstation. It provides a polished Linux OS for laptop and desktop computers and a complete set of tools for developers and consumers at all experience levels.\nFedora Server provides a flexible OS for users needing the latest data center technologies. The community also has Fedora IoT for foundation ecosystems, Fedora Cloud edition, and Fedora CoreOS for container-focused operations.\nAccording to Miller’s announcement in the online Fedora Magazine, Fedora 41 includes updates to thousands of packages, ranging from tiny patches to extensive new features. These include a new major release of the command-line package management tool, DNF (Dandified YUM), which improves performance and enhances dependency resolution.\nThe Workstation edition offers various desktop environment options, known as spins, including Xfce, LxQt, and Cinnamon. It also introduces a new line of Atomic-flavored desktops, which streamline updates by bundling them into a single image that users install, eliminating the need to download multiple package updates.\nFedora Workstation 41 is based on Gnome 47. One of its main changes is its customization potential. In the Appearance setting, you can change the standard blue accent color of Gnome interfaces, choosing from an assortment of vibrant colors. Enhanced small-screen support helps users with lower-resolution screens see optimized icons scaled for easier interaction and better visibility on smaller screens, and new-style dialogue windows enhance usability across many screen sizes.\nJack M.

    "content": "Deputy Editor, Infosecurity Magazine\nMicrosoft has seized 240 fraudulent websites associated with “do-it-yourself” phishing kits used by cybercriminals globally to break into customer accounts.\nThe action was enabled by a civil court order in the Eastern District of Virginia which allowed the malicious technical infrastructure to be directed to Microsoft. This permanently stops the use of these domains in phishing attacks in the future.\nThe websites are associated with Abanoub Nady, an Egypt-based individual known online as “MRxC0DER,” who developed and sold the phish kits to threat actors globally, fraudulently using the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) brand name to sell these services.\nONNX is a legitimate open standard format and open source runtime for representing machine learning models, enabling interoperability between different hardware, frameworks, and tools for easier deployment and scalability.\nNady and his associates marketed and sold their illicit offerings through branded storefronts, including the fraudulent ONNX Store.\nIn addition to the domain seizures, the Linux Foundation, the trademark owner of the actual registered “ONNX” name and logo, and Microsoft have sued Nady and four unidentified people for running ONNX. The defendants have been informed by the court that they must “appear” in this case or Microsoft and Linux will win automatically.\nMicrosoft said the action will substantially hamper the fraudulent operations of MRxC0DER.\n“Taking action sends a strong message to those who choose to replicate our services to harm users online: we will proactively pursue remedies to protect our services and our customers and are continuously improving our technical and legal strategies to have greater impact,” the tech giant stated.\nHowever, the firm acknowledged that other providers will fill the void and it expects threat actors to adapt their techniques in response.\nRead now: Microsoft and US Government Disrupt Russian Star Blizzard Operations\nMicrosoft said the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation run by Nady makes up a significant portion of the tens to hundreds of millions of phishing messages it sees every month.\nThe ONXX operations was among the top five phish kit providers by email volume in the first half of 2024.\nThe financial services industry has been particularly heavily targeted by phish kits sold on ONXX due to the sensitive data and transactions they handle, the firm noted.\nThe phish kits are designed to send emails at scale, specifically for coordinated phishing campaigns. They enable cybercriminal customers to conduct their own phishing attacks using the templates provided and the fraudulent ONNX technical infrastructure, including the website domains.\nCybercriminals can also use domains they purchase elsewhere and connect to the fraudulent ONNX technical infrastructure, enabling their phishing operations to grow and scale.  \nThe kits also facilitate adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing techniques, whereby attackers secretly inject themselves in network communications to steal credentials and cookies in order to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) defenses.\nThe fraudulent ONXX operation offers customers a subscription model, with Basic, Professional and Enterprise options, each for different tiers of access and support.\nEnterprise users can also purchase the add-on feature of “Unlimited VIP Support,” which provides step-by-step instructions on how to successfully use the phishing kits to commit cybercrime.  \nThe phish kits are promoted, sold and configured almost exclusively through Telegram.\nMicrosoft said it has tracked activity tied to Nady’s operation as far back as 2017. Other branded storefronts used alongside ONXX to sell the phish kits included “Caffeine” and “FUHRER.”\n",

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        In einem Statement fasst die Rust Foundation die Probleme bei der Interoperabilität zwischen Rust und C++ zusammen und bringt erste Lösungsansätze.\n      \n\n      (Bild: erstellt mit KI (Dall-E) von iX-Redaktion)\n    \nDie Rust Foundation hat auf GitHub ein Dokument veröffentlicht, das die größten Probleme beim Zusammenspiel zwischen Rust und C++ beschreibt. Die Stiftung schlägt kurzfristige und langfristige Maßnahmen für eine bessere Interoperabilität zwischen den Programmiersprachen vor.\nDas Dokument ist Teil der Interop Initivative: Google hat der Rust Foundation im Februar 2024 eine Fördersumme von einer Million US-Dollar zukommen lassen, um das Zusammenspiel von C++ und Rust zu verbessern.\nDie Interoperabilität ist vor allem in der systemnahen Programmierung gefragt. Dort hat Rust sich inzwischen etabliert, aber die wenigsten Projekte starten auf der grünen Wiese. Stattdessen treffen sie häufig auf vorhandene C++-Anwendungen.\nDas Dokument der Rust Foundation nennt drei Anwendungsfälle: C++-Systeme, die neue Funktionsweisen mit Rust umsetzen, Rust-Systeme, die auf vorhandenen C++-Code zurückgreifen, und Systeme mit mehreren Programmiersprachen, die unter anderem Rust implementieren. Da C++ auf eine deutlich längere Geschichte zurückblickt als Rust, ist der erste Anwendungsfall bei weitem der häufigste.\nDie Probleme treten vor allem auf Systemen mit begrenzten Ressourcen auf, unter anderem im Embedded-Umfeld.\nDie Integration von Rust in den Linux-Kernel ist kein Thema, da der Kernel keinen C++-Code enthält. Linus Torvalds hat C++ (und andere objektorientierte Sprachen) als furchtbare Sprache bezeichnet. Allerdings hat der Einzug von Rust in den Kernel in der Community Anfang 2024  auch wieder die Diskussion über C++ angefacht.\nBisher existiert keine Toolchain, die eine gemischte Codebasis aus C++- und Rust-Code in derselben Datei verarbeitet. Daher ist für das Zusammenspiel ein FFI-basierter (Foreign Function Interface) Ansatz erforderlich.\nDabei erfolgt die Anbindung derzeit über das Application Binary Interface (ABI) von C, da die C-ABIs stabiler und weniger plattformabhängig sind als die C++-ABIs. Der Umweg fällt vor allem dort ins Gewicht, wo C++-spezifische Features zunächst in die C-ABI überführt werden müssen.\nDas Zusammenspiel mit C stand von Anbeginn der Rust-Entwicklung auf der Agenda. Die Rust Foundation beschreibt C quasi als Lingua franca für die FFI-Integration. Die größten Herausforderungen sind, dass die Sicherheitsfunktionen von Rust beim Zusammenspiel mit C weitgehend verloren gehen und dass die Kommunikation auf einer gemeinsamen sprachlichen Ebene erfolgen muss, was Rust-Features einschränkt.\nBei den wichtigsten Tools für das Zusammenspiel von Rust mit den Programmiersprachen C und C++ sind bindgen, um C von Rust aufzurufen, und cbindgen, um Rust von C aufzurufen, deutlich umfangreicher als cxx für die bidirektionale Kommunikation zwischen Rust und C++.\nDie Rust Foundation benennt in ihrem \"C++/Rust Interoperability Problem Statement\" drei wesentliche Strategien, um das Zusammenspiel der Programmiersprachen zu verbessern.\nZunächst will die Stiftung zur Verbesserung der Tools beitragen und grundlegende Probleme im Rust-Projekt beseitigen, die das Zusammenspiel erschweren. Dann soll Konsens für eine Strategie gefunden werden, um Veränderungen für Rust auszumachen und vorzunehmen, die für die Interoperabilität erforderlich sind. Schließlich will die Foundation mit der C++-Community und dem C++-Standardkomitee zusammenarbeiten, um die Zusammenarbeit für beide Sprachen zu verbessern und gemeinsame Ziele bezüglich Sicherheit und Performance zu erreichen.\nWeitere Details lassen sich dem C++/Rust Problem Statement auf GitHub und der Ankündigung der Rust Foundation entnehmen.\n\n\n\n(rme)\n\n\n\n    montags und donnerstags - alles von heise developer\n  \n\n    Ausführliche Informationen zum Versandverfahren und zu Ihren\n    Widerrufsmöglichkeiten erhalten Sie in unserer\n    Datenschutzerklärung.\n  \n\n        Immer informiert bleiben: Klicken Sie auf das Plus-Symbol an einem Thema, um diesem zu folgen.

But it is not exclusive to developers—a beginner can make use of it and still have the same experience as any other operating system. In fact, Linux will significantly help in learning any field of computer science because of how versatile the operating system is.\nThere are quite a few open source collaborative projects on Linux, such as Hyperledger, a blockchain framework that gives you tools to build applications. Most recently, the quantum-resistant blockchain platform, QANplatform, joined the Linux Foundation and its Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance (PQCA) project for the development of quantum-safe solutions.\nSo if you are wondering, will quantum computing break bitcoin? You have nothing to worry about because this is not the first, as there are several other initiatives underway focused on creating quantum-proof solutions. Also known as post-quantum cryptography, this new technology will secure your systems and cryptocurrency from powerful quantum computers of the future. In no time Linux will get an array of quantum-safe wallets and security programs.\nIf a Linux-based device is your daily driver, then everything from media and content creation to software development and general computing use, each use case will require a stable app that can get the job done efficiently. With that and software developers in mind, we have compiled this list of open-source projects and apps for Linux.\npkg-config is a tool that simplifies the process of finding the correct paths for compiling and linking libraries in software projects. The tool provides you with the necessary details to pass to the compiler and can also be used by build automation software like CMake.\nGCC stands for GNU Compiler Collections and is one of the largest free programs out there, consisting of over 15 million lines of code. It is an open-source collection of compilers and libraries with support for various programming languages.\nHyperledger is an open-source blockchain project that offers frameworks and tools to build blockchain applications for various industries. It is an umbrella term for 12 other projects each offering unique tools and solutions.\nMono is an open source implementation of Microsoft’s .NET Framework designed for Linux and operating systems other than Windows. After the release of .NET Core (now called .NET.), mono has very specific use cases.\nOpenJDK is an open source version of the Java Development Kit which is made of a set of tools and software components that aid in building and running Java applications. It is used for creating scalable and secure applications\nGNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a free alternative to commercial programs like Adobe Photoshop. This powerful photo editor is packed with extensive features that let you bring your creative ideas to life. For free software it does everything that a paid program of its kind does and in some cases even better.\nBlender is your go-to software for crafting any 3D models, you even create entire animations with it. With Python scripts, you can easily import and export in Blender. Also, other functionalities, such as rendering and automation of repetitive tasks can be scripted.\nInkscape is a vector graphics editor mainly used for creating icons and pixel perfect logos. The program is tailor made for unix-like systems for designing graphs, illustrations, web graphics.\nKDevelop is a fully-featured C and C++ IDE but also supports other languages. It is the best code completion and project support program for Unix-like operating systems. Apart from being an intelligent code editor, it supports different build systems, such as CMake.\nPyCharm is a Python IDE, and much like other programs of its kind, it provides code analysis, syntax and error highlighting, navigation, and debugging features. It also supports web development with Django.\nQiskit is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for working on quantum algorithms and quantum systems. It is developed by IBM and is the highest performing quantum SDK as of this writing. You can install it on your Linux computer via Python.\nCirq is a Python framework developed by Google for writing and manipulating quantum programs on quantum simulators and quantum processors. These frameworks (Cirq and Qiskit) allow you to work on quantum algorithms even without a detailed knowledge of quantum mechanics.\nGeneral Use\nMozilla Thunderbird is a powerful email client with a large library of extensions and plugins that enhance its functionality and appearance.\nBrave Browser is easily the best and most secure web browser on Linux, with features that automatically block most ads and annoying pop-ups. Its designed philosophy revolves around privacy, and it makes sure that your data is not tracked. It also has a built-in crypto wallet.\n",

    "content": "\n    Il modello Llama di Meta si scontra con la definizione di IA \"aperta\" dell'Open Source Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n            a cura di\n            \n                                    \n    Luca Zaninello\n\n                        \n\n        \n\n                Managing Editor\n            \nL'Open Source Initiative (OSI) ha definito ufficialmente cosa significa \"open source\" nel contesto dell'intelligenza artificiale (AI), presentando criteri che potrebbero non essere compatibili con i modelli di giganti tecnologici come Meta. La definizione di OSI richiede pieno accesso ai dettagli del set di dati usati per l'addestramento degli algoritmi, al codice completo e alle impostazioni di peso utilizzate durante la formazione del modello. Questo standard si scontra direttamente con il modello Llama di Meta, che, sebbene sia etichettato come open source, impone restrizioni all'uso commerciale e non fornisce accesso ai dati di formazione.\nLa definizione di AI open source di OSI riflette l'intento di promuovere un ambiente tecnologico dove innovatori e sviluppatori possono collaborare e migliorare reciprocamente i propri progetti senza barriere legali o tecniche. Questo approccio è saldo nella tradizione OSI di trasparenza e disponibilità che ha guidato il mondo del software libero per oltre un quarto di secolo. La nuova definizione mira a trasferire questi valori anche nel campo emergente dell'intelligenza artificiale, ma incontra la resistenza di compagnie che, come Meta, hanno investito risorse significative nello sviluppo di AI e vedono nel controllo sui dati di addestramento un vantaggio competitivo.\n\n                    Valido dal 21 Novembre al 02 Dicembre\n                     - \n                    \n                    Risparmia su centinaia di prodotti!\n                \n\n                        Segui il Black Friday con Tom's Hardware!\n                    \n\n                        Le migliori offerte selezionate dai più grandi store online con sconti fino al 70%!\n                    \nIl portavoce di Meta, Faith Eischen, ha chiarito:\n\"Mentre concordiamo con OSI su molti aspetti, non condividiamo questa definizione. L'elaborazione di una definizione univoca di AI open source è complessa e le definizioni precedenti non catturano le sfide delle tecnologie AI moderne.\"\nEischen ha anche aggiunto che la collaborazione con OSI e altre organizzazioni continuerà per rendere l'intelligenza artificiale più accessibile e libera, rispettando però le specificità tecniche del settore.\n\n\nStefano Maffulli, direttore esecutivo di OSI, paragona l'attuale resistenza delle grandi aziende tecnologiche agli atteggiamenti storici di società come Microsoft durante l'ascesa del software open source. Osserva che la reticenza nell'aprire completamente i dati di training è spesso motivata da questioni di responsabilità legale e mantenimento del vantaggio competitivo.\nParallelamente alle discussioni sui criteri che definiscono l'open source nell'intelligenza artificiale, organizzazioni come la Linux Foundation stanno lavorando su definizioni alternative. Clément Delangue, CEO di Hugging Face, ritiene che la definizione di OSI sia \"un enorme aiuto nel plasmare la conversazione sull'apertura nell'AI, specialmente per quanto riguarda il ruolo cruciale dei dati di addestramento\". \n\n    \n\t\t\t\tFonte dell'articolo: www.theverge.com\n\t\t\t\n\nNon perdere gli\n        ultimi\n        aggiornamenti\nAdvertisement\n\n                            \n                        \n\n                        Tom's Hardware - Testata giornalistica associata all'USPI Unione Stampa Periodica\n                        Italiana,\n                        registrata presso il Tribunale di Milano, nr. 285 del 9/9/2013 - Direttore: Andrea Ferrario\n                        \n                        3LABS S.R.L. • Via Dante 16 - Milano (MI) 20121\n                        CF/P.IVA: 04146420965 - REA: MI - 1729249 - Capitale Sociale: 10.000 euro\n                        \n                        © 2024 3Labs Srl.

Star the project and become a stargazer.\nLynis - Security auditing and hardening tool, for UNIX-based systems.\nLynis is a security auditing tool for systems based on UNIX like Linux, macOS, BSD, and others. It performs an in-depth security scan and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security defenses and provide tips for further system hardening. It will also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible configuration issues. Lynis was commonly used by system administrators and auditors to assess the security defenses of their systems. Besides the \"blue team,\" nowadays penetration testers also have Lynis in their toolkit.\nWe believe software should be simple, updated on a regular basis, and open. You should be able to trust, understand, and have the option to change the software. Many agree with us, as the software is being used by thousands every day to protect their systems.\nThe main goals are:\nThe software (also) assists with:\nTypical users of the software:\nThere are multiple options available to install Lynis.\nFor systems running Linux, BSD, and macOS, there is typically a package available. This is the preferred method of obtaining Lynis, as it is quick to install and easy to update. The Lynis project itself also provides packages in RPM or DEB format suitable for systems systems running:\nCentOS, Debian, Fedora, OEL, openSUSE, RHEL, Ubuntu, and others.\nSome distributions may also have Lynis in their software repository: \nNote: Some distributions don't provide an up-to-date version. In that case it is better to use the CISOfy software repository, download the tarball from the website, or download the latest GitHub release.\nThe very latest developments can be obtained via git.\nClone or download the project files (no compilation nor installation is required) ;\nExecute:\nIf you want to run the software as root (or sudo), we suggest changing the ownership of the files. Use chown -R 0:0 to recursively alter the owner and group and set it to user ID 0 (root). Otherwise Lynis will warn you about the file permissions. After all, you are executing files owned by a non-privileged user.\nThis software component is also part of an enterprise solution.

    "content": "cmtops.dev\nsite menu\npages\n•\n~20 min read\nFor the past half a year, I’ve been working on building an experimental observability project — among many other tasks and projects —\nfor infrastructure at my current company.\nAfter trying out a few different tech stacks, I’ve settled on using ClickHouse for data warehouse\nand Grafana for visualizations and alerting.\nThis post is going to be a summary of this journey.\nIt will give you a little insight on other tech stacks, and the reasoning behind the final choice.\nPlease note that this experience is highly subjective, so it may diverge from yours.\nMy little “research” started with\nthis Reddit thread,\nbut I couldn’t get answers optimal for my situation, so here we are, about 7 months later with a bag of experience 😁.\nThere are a lot more things I didn’t write about since it would take an eternity to finish this article. Grab something to drink and\nenjoy reading 🍵.\nBefore getting into the new stack, it makes sense to tell you a bit about what we had initially.\nEverything started with the Elastic Stack — EFK, more specifically.\nWe used it to collect NGINX access and error logs, and cron jobs execution logs.\nIt was enough to create some basic visualizations with generic metrics calculated based on data from the logs, and to do\nsome trivial full-text searching.\nBut at some point we realized that it eats up almost 200 GB of disk space with the default compression codec\njust to store logs data of the past 14-15 days for a bit over a dozen of websites.\nNot only resource-intensive, it was noticeably slow to calculate metrics, and quite inflexible in terms of data manipulation.\nElasticsearch is a search engine, after all.\nAfter trying out the DEFLATE codec, disk space usage reduced by a half, but with a query performance cost.\n\nBut Elasticsearch performance comes with horizontal scaling!\n— you might say. Absolutely. Someone still needs to maintain this,\nand other resources usage doesn’t disappear. It runs on JVM.\nSince I was the only one who operated this, there are two more subjective things that annoyed me: JSON API and\nPainless (the Elasticsearch scripting language).\nThe latter one is painful to use, and it lacks a coherent reference. At least, that was the case at the time.\nI don’t like being forced to query and manipulate data using a JSON-based HTTP API instead of a DSL designed specifically for that\npurpose. It was painful not only because of this, but also because of some imperfections in the API documentation — don’t\nget me wrong, a lot of software has similar problems on the documentation side.\nThis stack was in operation for about a year or so, and despite the developers’ teamlead being against its replacement\ndue to his familiarity with it, I pushed the change. We must be prepared to collect data from all of our infra, not only websites.\nObservability is key to improvement.\nWhat we need is a cost-effective, vertically scalable bulldozer powerhouse made specifically for data crunching. Want to query logs?\nHere you go. Some metrics too? Come on, take them.\nIt has to have a powerful query language and be able to layout the data exactly how we want it without too much hustle.\nPreferrably, a dialiect of SQL, so that knowledge can be somewhat portable between tech stacks.\nThere must be a lot of integrations with other software for data ingestion and output.\nAs we are gradually refining our legacy infrastructure in pursuit to make it\nmore maintainable and resilient, there’s a planned project for deployment of critical services in multiple\ndistributed geographical locations. Therefore, the data warehouse for observability must either support replication,\nor high availability. Probably both.\nClickHouse satisfies all of the above. Yet, next you will find some information on other software considered before it.\nAt first, I wanted to try out Elasticsearch with Grafana, because I was unsure about the future of this project.\nMaybe we could optimize the warehouse, and just use a more sophisticated visualization software.\nAs it turned out, Elasticsearch integration with Grafana has quirky limitations making it an unfeasible solution for some.\nEven in comparison with OpenSearch, an\nElasticsearch fork by Amazon.\nThere’s no way to make it query data without grouping which is not always needed. See this issue.\nThe next logical step was to try out a subset of the Grafana Labs’ LGTM stack.\nI personally didn’t like it. Loki’s documentation was very lacking at some points when I last tried it half a year ago.\nIt took a lot of time for me to figure out even basic things in terms of just setting it up.\nIt has a lot of moving parts, too. The setup can be tricky, especially if you know that you will need to scale in future.\nFor some reason, Grafana Labs change their supported data backends\nfor Loki incredibly frequently. They get deprecated, and the new ones are added. At least, they provide means for seemingly\nadequate migration to the new ones.\nYet, this is unacceptable for a small team that needs stability in terms of frequency of change in the foundation of infrastructure,\nand cannot throw their resources at learning all the new\ndata backends coming to swap out those in operation.\nIt seemed like the project is moving towards switching to s3 for data storage completely. s3 is good for storing certain types of data,\nand we are starting to migrate to it from NFS for storing backups in a more secure and comfortable way. Yet, I don’t like\nthe idea of using it to store tons of small blocks of log data. That’s subjective, nothing more.\nLoki’s query language, LogQL was very underdocumented at the time of trying this stack. It felt like one needs to learn\nPrometheus’ PromQL first — LogQL was inspired by it. This is unacceptable with limited human workforce.\nWhen it comes to working with data, Loki should be thought of more like a distributed grep rather than a data crunching piece of software.\nIt can help you find the exact events in the logs you need, and it’s really good at it. But if you need something more advanced, like severely transform data\nor calculate metrics based on logs, it gets painfully slow. The tool isn’t meant for that.\nThis section is combined. It’s about Timescale and InfluxDB.\nI didn’t try to spin up these two DBMSes to try out, but I read a lot of their documentation and other engineers’\nopinions. Both of them have integrations with Grafana, as well.\nTimescale is an extension to Postgres. It’s designed specifically for working with timeseries data. If something has an\nintegration with Postgres, you can use it with Timescale too. This is a DBMS I considered on par with ClickHouse, but chose\nthe latter one due to its popularity — hence, more resouces and community support by default.\nI suggest you try this one when comparing different data warehouses. It should be a good experience.\nThe free version with open source licenses doesn’t have clustering capabilities.\nAn immediate no-no for our requirements.\nBut if you will use it, keep in mind that it uses Bolt as its data backend. The same Bolt used in the HashiCorp\nVault integrated Raft storage and in etcd. Hence, it may need some maintenance too. More specifically,\ndatabase compaction.\nHere’s the full list of Bolt’s caveats and limitations.\nMy acquaintance with this project was brief. I set it up, played around with the interface, and didn’t like it.\nThe community version had a lot of limitations as well, some of which got removed later. The project is still in its early stages,\nand I’m sure it is a perfect option for some people. Not for me, unfortunately.\n\nTo collect, parse, prepare data, and send it to ClickHouse, I use a combination of Fluent Bit and\nVector. Later, rsyslog will be used as well.\nEach of them is a good tool for a specific type of work, but not without their caveats, unfortunately.\nIt is a simple and stable tool. You can rely on it. The documentation is there, and it’s enough most of the time.\nWhen you use Fluent Bit to collect data from a file, you use the Tail plugin. It doesn’t start collecting data until\nthe file is changed. This can be a bit uncomfortable/unoptimal in some environments.\nBecause of this, during tests, I used to manually touch(1) a log file, or append data to it.\nThis tool is comfortable to use, and has an interesting approach to data collection and transformation.\nIt has a powerful data manipulation language, VRL.\nYou use it to create small data parsing and modification programs. It gets compiled during Vector configuration load.\nThe language itself is really easy to use and has a familiar syntax inspired\nby Rust, sans all the complexity of the latter one.\nIt is a safe language by default, providing compile-time correctness checks. When some function can fail, you must handle\nthis. Otherwise, the program won’t compile, and Vector won’t start.\nWhen it comes to error messages, they are as good as Rust’s. Clear and concise, straight to the point, and with\nvisual hints.\nAs an example, below you can see our current Vector config for collecting NGINX logs for all of the websites served by\none of our reverse proxies.\nSometimes, it cannot properly parse data using special functions. NGINX error log parsing function is the one I had problems with.\nBecause of that, I decided to not parse error logs. They get stored as-is.\nIn addition to that, Vector can lose some of your data read from a file with the File data source 🤪.\nWhen that happens, records in ClickHouse look like the following:\nTake a look at this issue of mine that appeared to be a duplicate\nof this one which is still open since Nov 15, 2021.\nI think, as a workaround, we’ll start to use Fluent Bit to collect data and send it to a centralized Vector instance for processing\nbefore ingestion into the warehouse.\nGrafana has a quality integration plugin for ClickHouse developed with help from ClickHouse, Inc.\nYou can work with data as flexible as possible, the imagination is the limit, mostly.\nThe full power of ClickHouse SQL dialect is at your disposal to crunch data and build visualizations with metrics.\nGrafana natively supports all of the ClickHouse datatypes, and they can also be converted and transformed using\nGrafana’s data transformation tools.\nTo query data, a query builder can be used, or a query editor to write SQL code directly. I prefer the latter one due to\nthe level of flexibility it provides.\nThe only problem I had with this integration is\nad hoc filters.\nSometimes, they don’t change what data is displayed on the dashboard if you use nested queries and lots of aggregations.\nI decided to not use these filters at all for that reason. It’s better to create a yet another variable if you need some specific\nfiltering on a regular basis.\nLet’s take a look at an example. If you recall the post banner image, it has a Response Codes Over Time visualization\nrepresenting stacked HTTP response codes with variable binning for a chosen website.\nUnder the hood, it has the SQL query presented below.\nWhat we get by executing the query above, is a two-column output with a timestamp and a Map(K, V) with status codes as keys and\ntheir count as values.\n\nBy itself, this data cannot be fed to the timeseries visualization. The reason is, it works with columns of data only.\nOne of the columns is a timestamp, and others represent data to be visualized.\nClickHouse JOINs may be limiting sometimes. For example, you cannot use arbitrary WHERE clauses with them.\nI encountered that when I was building the aforementioned visualization.\nThat’s not bad per se, it forced me to come up with a better solution to my problem. It took a couple of days brainstorming and\nwhiteboarding since this is my first exposure to such databases with that type of problems.\n\nTo make it work with the timeseries visualization type, first we extract the Map into separate columns using the\nExtract fields\ntransformation.\n\nAfter that, the original column containing Map objects must be hidden. It’s no longer needed.\nFor that, the Organize fields by name\ntransformation can be used.\n\nThese modifications result in a table suitable for this type of visualization.\n\nIt may take some mental work to adapt to the approach of manually building and tuning both a data warehouse and a visualization\nlayer for each of your log types.\nAs with everything new, it takes quite a lot of time, and trial and error. With every new visualization and dashboard,\nyou gradually get better and faster at this.\nMy approach to laying out data and building dashboards comes down to several stages:\nAnd remember to always:\nAvoid creating indexes for too many columns. Pick one or a couple that will always be used for primary filtering, like\na timestamp. More narrow filtering will do without indexes.\nAny software has its quirks. Grafana and ClickHouse are a subject to this sometimes.\nWhen I started using TTLs to configure data retention periods in ClickHouse, they didn’t work for some reason.\nThis was fixed by updating the DBMS instance.\nAfter several more updates, all of my queries for an NGINX dashboard broke. This happened between versions v24.2 and v24.3\ndespite not having any breaking changes in the release notes. It took a lot of time to debug, and it turned out, outer\nCTEs stopped working with nested queries.\nSince then, the visualizations’ queries have changed significantly because I get better at both Grafana and ClickHouse,\nand the NGINX access dashboard is starting to stabilize. Below you can take a look at the original query for one of the visualizations.\nIt’s refined in the current version.\nAnd here’s the diff with modifications I had to make:\nThe larger the data selection, the slower queries become. When you filter or aggregate over a large set of data —\ncalculating metrics for a dashboard, or searching in logs during incident response — you will wait for ClickHouse to\nselect the data you need.\nTo improve this for dashboards with metrics, wait until your visualizations stabilize in terms of their tuning and modification,\nand figure out perhaps some data used for their calculation should be extracted into separate columns, or even pre-calculated using\nmaterialized views. By doing so, you won’t be so hard on ClickHouse\nserver’s hardware and your PC’s browser from the Grafana side.\nNot only Grafana has a handful of visualization types with abilities for data transformation,\nand dozens of useful plugins, it’s heavily customizable, and supports altering.\nMarkdown can be used in visualization descriptions for enhanced customization.\nSeveral types of variables\ncan be used for templating dashboards allowing to make them more dynamic.\nThey can be referenced in both visualization queries and their titles/descriptions providing more context to users.\nTo demonstrate the amount of flexibility available when building visualizations, let’s consider a couple of them\n\nThe Top N URLs Pattern and Top N URLs visualizations above use a variable top_urls_num to change titles, description, and query\nbased on user input at the top of the dashboard to eliminate confusion when analyzing data.\n\n\nTake a look at the Response Codes Over Time visualization legend. The HTTP status codes are sorted by name in ascending order, and colored by range.\n200s are green, 300s are blue, etc.\nThat way, it’s easy to analyze which status codes are present in a specific time range, and which are dominant.\n\nHere’s a quick insight into how it’s colored and sorted based on data.\nTo achieve coloring based on status codes range, I used Grafana visualization overrides for fields matching regex.\n\nTo sort status codes on the legend, its type should be set to table, and it must be sorted manually by clicking on the legend\ntitle. The order will be preserved on dashboard save.\nSpeaking of Grafana alerting capabilities, this is a topic for a whole another article, so I won’t provide too much information here.\nBelow is an example of a message from a custom Telegram bot connected to Grafana.\n\nSuch alerts are generated using special alert rules containing data source queries and some Grafana-specific parameters defining the behaviour of these alerts.\n\nFor ClickHouse, just like with visualizations, either a query builder or an SQL editor can be used to query data for further evaluation using Grafana rules.\n\nClickHouse supports a ton of FORMATs for input and output data.\nIts CLI client allows to execute powerful queries and chain their input and output with other CLI tools using pipes in the shell.\nThis is a very powerful approach to data manipulation.\nFor example, during an incident response, one can query some data, output it using a desired data format, pipe through\ngzip for compression, and redirect to a file. Our team uses this approach\nquite frequently, works like a charm.\nThere are several table engines implemented in ClickHouse,\nallowing for flexible data layout for your needs.\nSome are in-memory, some are based on persistent storage. Some store data as-is, and some perform aggregations to reduce\ndisk usage.\nThere is a lot of parameters that can be tuned for specific workload. From per-column compression codec, to internal performance\noptimizations.\nIt has numerous integrations for data input and output.\n $ \nThere’s also a very powerful CLI tool called clickhouse-local. It provides many capabilities of the ClickHouse Server\nwithout being required to run a server. This is useful when you need to manipulate or analyze very large datasets, and prepare\nthem for usage with other software.\nAll of the queries can be piped with other tools as well.\n $ \nSince this stack proved to be a suitable solution in our company’s case, the project will gradually evolve:\nCompanies like Cloudflare, ClickHouse, and Uber also use ClickHouse as their observability data warehouse. Which means, with time there will\nbe even more learning resources and tools.\nHere are some cases:\nI plan to write a follow-up article about NGINX observability using ClickHouse and Grafana with more in-depth walkthrough\nat some point in future when the project becomes more polished and functional. Stay tuned.\nEvery tool needs tuning and dedication. There’s no single silver bullet for every company and team, so compare all the options\nyou have, and choose visely based on your requirements.\nRead Next\nThank you for reading, and have a good rest of your day!

With all those infrastructure-y things you notice when bridges collapse, floods wash away lives, swathes of formerly arable land stop yielding crops.\n\n\nMore insidious things like education, public health are in the same category: you can save a shitload of money today, later generations will have to pay back two orders of magnitude times that, plus some lives to go with it.\n\n\nFree software (called \"open source\" by those who like to raid the commons) has become infrastructure of sorts, for better or worse.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 21:06 UTC (Thu)\n                               by khim (subscriber, #9252)\n                              [Link] \n      \nI find that note very funny in a light of the simple fact that the majority of what people call “free software” was made by people from “open source” camp (that is: the ones who don't subscribe to the idea that world without proprietary software is possible or even desirable).\nIt was mostly inevitable. Maybe it should be treated like the other kinds of infrastructure as be paid by taxpayers money?\nNo one know what's the best way to fund the infrastructure, but that's how the majority of infrastructure is supported in other areas, why should software be any different?\nI guess we would need to first ensure each country would have it's own local open source core software first… the first step in that direction was done, but I wonder how long would it take to finally reach that state where we would no longer have one single Linux, one single Rust, one single C++… years?… decades?…\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 13:49 UTC (Thu)\n                               by Lennie (subscriber, #49641)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 9:55 UTC (Thu)\n                               by jengelh (subscriber, #33263)\n                              [Link] (5 responses)\n      \n\nReporting, reporting. I do not recall seeing e.g. an LWN article about an impending non-maintenance prior to September 2024. I guess I am also asking that everyone be more open about their state of mind early on. No one should feel ashamed for posting a terse \"I have been considering stepping down [optionally insert timeframe or reasons]\".\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 13:34 UTC (Thu)\n                               by alx.manpages (guest, #145117)\n                              [Link] (4 responses)\n      \n\n```\n-- \n\u003chttps://www.alejandro-colomar.es/\u003e\nLooking for a remote C programming job at the moment.\n```\n(e.g.: \u003chttps://lore.kernel.org/linux-man/ZgifHQoTaDEiga0W@debian...\u003e)\n\n\nYeah, the audience of it is rather small, but that was as much as I could do.  Some companies such as the big Linux distributors probably received and ignored the message.\n\n\nI think it's difficult to find a way that would have prevented this situation from happening.  In fact, Red Hat still firmly opposes contributing with money to the maintenance the project.  I think it was good that this brought the attention of so many people, and I think my case is just one instance.  I hope this helps many other maintainers of FOSS projects in the long term.\n\n\nWe can't require companies to pay for FOSS projects.  I think it's up to each company to do what is morally correct.  And that moral is up to each company or individual user.  Just like as individuals we can decide to tip more or less for services we like and want to continue.\n\n\nI for example live in Aldaya, one of the villages struck by flooding a few days ago.  For resuming normal life, I need a butcher, a fish market, a computer parts store, etc.  If I pay for their products and services at the price they sell them, I won't have the products at all, because they won't be able to open again any soon.  Being kind-of privileged, I feel morally obliged to donate some amount of money for the recovery, plus lending at 0% a larger amount.  That will benefit me in the form of having these stores again ASAP.  Even before this flooding happened, I already tipped those good stores significantly so that they would continue providing their great products and services (the butcher provides exceptional-quality meat, from the mountains of the north of Spain); those stores are not very profitable under normal operation.\n\n\nIn the end it's up to each user to pay more than is required to have a continued good service or product.  Paying the minimum (which for FOSS is 0) may eventually result in a Market for Lemons.  I don't want to have to go buy meat from a supermarket where they bring them from animals that never saw the Sun, and so I opt to pay more than required.  But how many people, and especially companies, have that mentality?\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 21:18 UTC (Thu)\n                               by khim (subscriber, #9252)\n                              [Link] (3 responses)\n      \nWorld simply doesn't work like that. If company is public (IBM and thus RedHat are public companies as well as most other large companies that do things for Linux) then they have to do what their shareholders want, and, very expcliticly, not what is morally correct.\nAnd while shareholders may theoretically, demand that company should do “morally correct” things, but in practice they vote, more often than not, essentially 100 times out of 100, for one and one thing only: screw as many people as you can, fuck everyone as hard as you could, just give us money.\nExceptions are rare (e.g. government-owned company may do something that is good for the government, not what is good for other shareholders and not what is good for the company itself), but even then “morally correct” is never part of the equation.\nIndividuals could do that. Most companies couldn't. It's as simple as that.\nMost companies simply couldn't have that mentality. And even if their owners have that mentality they usually separate their community support (which surprising number of them provide, for real!) from what their company is doing.\nAnd even for them free software is an enigma: their company benefits from the free software, and they don't need that free software at all, but now they have to pay for something that they, personally, don't need or want to help their company?\nThis just feels so much wrong on so many levels…\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 17, 2024 2:18 UTC (Sun)\n                               by milesrout (subscriber, #126894)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\nThis is a bit silly. The duties of directors to their shareholders have never been to maximise profit by \"screwing\" people or \"profit above all else\". This idea has been repeated a lot online in the last few years but is quite untrue. In practice, directors are given a lot of leeway to argue that their actions are beneficial to the company. For example, they can argue that what they are doing is worth it because it is good for the company's public image, or is an investment in future profits, or is good for recruitment/retention/morale of employees. This is obvious when you see how many companies do obviously unprofitable things like sponsoring public events, giving away scholarships, giving people pay rises and discretionary bonuses, etc. \n\n\nPractically, the actions of directors are much more driven by what shareholders want than any legal duty on them to maximise profits. But most shareholders of large public companies are not activist shareholders. They are largely passive institutional investors that just want good return on their investments. The current \"ESG\" focus also means many of them are pushing for more focus on other factors like public image, diversity box ticking, environmental box ticking, etc. over pure short term profit seeking.\n\n\nI take particular issue with your \"very explicitly not what is morally correct\". Nowhere in law does it require directors to disregard moral principles. Also, people differ widely on moral principles. Whose do you think they should take into account? To use a controversial example, many people took issue with GitHub providing services to the immigration enforcement agency (ICE) in the US, believing that ICE was bad. But a different group of people would have taken issue with them NOT working with them, believing that ICE was a force for good. So if you start getting into moral issues you can get into a real quagmire very easily and end up pissing everyone off. I would rather the companies I (indirectly) invest in just focused on what they are good at which is their core business.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 17, 2024 12:39 UTC (Sun)\n                               by Wol (subscriber, #4433)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nAnd if you don't approve of that business, don't invest! :-)\n\n\nThis is where I, personally, think the massive growth of personal pensions, 401Ks etc, has done a lot of harm. It's funnelled huge amounts of money into faceless investment engines that are heavily profit driven.\n\n\nI'm all for pension funds, but they should be far smaller and, certainly, if your personal pot is - let's say - over twice the average size, you should be obliged to invest in companies and specialist funds of your choice, not let your voice be anonymised by a faceless profit engine.\n\n\nBut this is getting into politics ... :-)\n\n\nCheers,\nWol\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 17, 2024 16:44 UTC (Sun)\n                               by raven667 (subscriber, #5198)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n\u003e I take particular issue with your \"very explicitly not what is morally correct\". Nowhere in law does it require directors to disregard moral principles\n\n\nThis is a bit of a tangent, but while this may be true in some literal technical sense it presumes that the people running a company, the managers, executives and board of directors are logical beings trying to make a financial profit, in fact companies are run by people who are primarily emotional beings and a vast number of companies are run to satisfy some emotional needs of the managers, executives and board of directors, so profit will be left behind to pursue goals of \"screwing\" people (customers, employees, competitors) more often than you'd think if you believed companies were motivated by some rational profit-seeking impulse.\n\n\nIf profit-seeking was the main impulse, companies would be run a lot more competently more often, is what I'm saying.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 8:42 UTC (Thu)\n                               by xose (guest, #535)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 9:44 UTC (Thu)\n                               by donaldh (subscriber, #151569)\n                              [Link] (3 responses)\n      \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 15:33 UTC (Thu)\n                               by alx.manpages (guest, #145117)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\nOn the other hand, we could say I was funding my work there from my own pocket, which was itself full thanks to having a good job.  :-)\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 7, 2024 17:17 UTC (Thu)\n                               by NightMonkey (subscriber, #23051)\n                              [Link] (1 responses)\n      \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 8, 2024 1:26 UTC (Fri)\n                               by alx.manpages (guest, #145117)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n\n            \n            Copyright © 2024, Eklektix, Inc.\n            \n            Comments and public postings are copyrighted by their creators.\n            Linux  is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds\n            \n            \n",

This evolution highlights how attackers are finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities across platforms.\nHelldown first grabbed attention in mid-2024, targeting Windows systems. It borrows its foundation from LockBit 3.0, a notorious ransomware family, and shows behavioral overlaps with other rebrands like Darkrace and Donex. Its latest Linux variant takes things further by targeting VMware virtual machines (VMs), aiming to kill active VMs before encryption. Interestingly, though, researchers found this feature isn't fully functional yet, indicating it's still in development.\nOn the Windows side, Helldown’s tactics are less refined than other advanced ransomware strains. For example, it uses batch files to terminate processes instead of more sophisticated, embedded methods. Even so, its focus on crippling VMs and encrypting data shows the attackers are planning something big. A key feature of the Helldown ransomware's attack chain is its use of vulnerabilities in Zyxel’s VPN devices. Specifically, it exploits the CVE-2024-42057 vulnerability, a command injection flaw in the IPSec VPN, which allows attackers to execute OS commands with a crafted username.\nThe attackers exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to breach networks. Once inside, they use simple yet effective tools to escalate privileges, disable security, and exfiltrate data. The Linux variant raises eyebrows because, unlike its Windows counterpart, it lacks common evasion tricks like obfuscation. This simplicity suggests it’s a work-in-progress but still dangerous. Targeting VMs lets ransomware operators maximize the damage. By taking out VMs, they can disrupt critical operations in IT and other industries.\nThis year has been a wild ride for ransomware attacks—bigger and a whole lot smarter. One of the big scares was the \"ESXiArgs\" ransomware, which hammered VMware vSphere servers globally. It wasn’t even a fresh zero-day vulnerability; attackers just took advantage of systems that hadn’t been patched for years. Props to CISA, though, for stepping in with their recovery script, which helped some victims bounce back without forking over a ransom.\nOn top of that, Microsoft’s security report painted an even scarier picture: cybercriminals and even state-backed actors are stepping up their game with AI-powered attacks. Groups like North Korea’s FakePenny aren’t just after cash—they’re doing double duty by stealing sensitive data while they’re at it.\nSource: The Hacker News\n\n                    \n                                                    Justin Luna\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Mar 10, 2023\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            19\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Justin Luna\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Feb 23, 2023\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            0\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Justin Luna\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Feb 16, 2023\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            8\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                    \n                                                    Sayan Sen\n                                                ·\n                    \n                                            Feb 8, 2023\n                                                            \n                        with\n                            1\n                            comment\n                                                            \n                        \n                    \n                \nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\n\n                                cuktech s15 se\n                                \n\n                                terramaster f4-424 max\n                                \n\n                                unifydrive\n                                \n\n                                silent hill 2\n                                \n\n                                manba one\n                                \n\n                        windows 11 24h2\n                        \n\n                        windows 11 24h2 unsupported\n                        \n\n                        hard drive\n                        \n\n                        windows insider\n                        \n\n                                    © Since 2000 Neowin®\n                                    All trademarks mentioned are the property of their respective owners.\n                                \n",

    "content": "Common problems companies solve with Go\nStories about how and why companies use Go\nHow Go can help keep you secure by default\nTips for writing clear, performant, and idiomatic Go code\nA complete introduction to building software with Go\nReference documentation for Go's standard library\nLearn what's new in each Go release\nVideos from prior events\nMeet other local Go developers\nLearn and network with Go developers from around the world\nThe Go project's official blog.\nGet help and stay informed from Go\n\nThis package is not in the latest version of its module.\n\n          The Go module system was introduced in Go 1.11 and is the official dependency management\n          solution for Go.\n        \n\n          Redistributable licenses place minimal restrictions on how software can be used,\n          modified, and redistributed.\n        \nModules with tagged versions give importers more predictable builds.\nWhen a project reaches major version v1 it is considered stable.\n\nUsing Go embedded images (_examples/photo.go).\n\nCascading menus (_examples/menu.go)\nMenus on darwin are now using the system-managed menu bar.\n\nRich text using markup (_examples/text.go).\n\nUsing svg (_examples/svg.go).\n\nA simple calculator (_examples/calc.go).\n\nA font previewer (_examples/font.go).\n\nSurface plot (_examples/splot.go). This example requires Gnuplot 5.4+ installation.\n\nInterlocked tori plot (_examples/tori.go). This example requires Gnuplot 5.4+ installation.\n\nInterlocked tori plot on canvas (_examples/tori_canvas.go). This example requires Gnuplot 5.4+ installation.\n\nRendering plain TeX (_examples/tex.go). No runtime dependencies required.\n\nEmbedding pictures, TeX and other widgets in Text (_examples/embed.go).\nThis program additionally demonstrates some techniques for handling non-default scale factors.\n\nThe above screen shot is from '$ TK9_SCALE=1.2 go run _examples/embed.go'.\n\nStyling a button (_examples/tbutton.go). See the discussion at Tutorial: Modifying a ttk button's style\n\nExample usage of the theme register. (_examples/azure.go)\n\nTechnology preview of a Bootstrap 5-like theme buttons (_examples/b5.go). Only\na partial prototype/problem study/work in progress at the moment. But it may\nget there, eventually. (_examples/b5.go)\nGallery (_examples/demo.go)\nDarwin(macOS) Sequoia 15.0\n\nFreeBSD Xfce4\n\nLinux Mate 1.26.0\n\nWindows 11\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage tk9.0 is a CGo-free, cross platform GUI toolkit for Go. It is\nsimilar to Tkinter for Python.\n\nAlso available in _examples/hello.go\n\nTo execute the above program on any supported target issue something like\n\nThe CGO_ENABLED=0 is optional and here it only demonstrates the program can\nbe built without CGo.\n\nWindows: How to build an executable that doesn't open a console window when run?\n\nFrom the documentation for cmd/link: On Windows, -H windowsgui writes\na \"GUI binary\" instead of a \"console binary.\". To pass the flag to the\nGo build system use 'go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui somefile.go', for\nexample.\n\nConsider this program in _examples/debugging.go:\n\nExecute the program using the tags as indicated, then close the window or\nclick the Hello button. With the tk.dmesg tag the package initialization\nprints the debug messages path. So we can view it, for example, like this:\n\n18876 was the process PID in this particular run. Using the tags allows to\ninspect the Tcl/Tk code executed during the lifetime of the process.\n\nThese combinations of GOOS and GOARCH are currently supported\n\nSpecific to FreeBSD:\n\nWhen building with cross-compiling or CGO_ENABLED=0, add the following\nargument to `go` so that these symbols are defined by making fakecgo the\nCgo.\n\nBuilder results available at modern-c.appspot.com.\n\nAt the moment the package is a MVP allowing to build at least some simple,\nyet useful programs. The full Tk API is not yet usable. Please report\nneeded, but non-exposed Tk features at the issue tracker, thanks.\n\nProviding feedback about the missing building blocks, bugs and your user\nexperience is invaluable in helping this package to eventually reach version\n1. See also RERO.\n\nThe ErrorMode variable selects the behaviour on errors for certain\nfunctions that do not return error.\n\nWhen ErrorMode is PanicOnError, the default, errors will panic, providing a stack trace.\n\nWhen ErrorMode is CollectErrors, errors will be recorded using errors.Join in\nthe Error variable.  Even if a function does not return error, it is still\npossible to handle errors in the usual way when needed, except that Error is\nnow a static variable. That's a problem in the general case, but less so in\nthis package that must be used from a single goroutine only, as\ndocumented elsewhere.\n\nThis is obviously a compromise enabling to have a way to check for errors\nand, at the same time, the ability to write concise code like:\n\nThere are altogether four different places where the call to the Button\nfunction can produce errors as additionally to the call itself, every of its\nthree arguments can independently fail as well.  Checking each and one of\nthem separately is not always necessary in GUI code. But the explicit option\nin the first example is still available when needed.\n\nThere is a centralized theme register in Themes. Theme providers can opt\nin to call RegisterTheme at package initialization to make themes\ndiscoverable at run-time. Clients can use ActivateTheme to apply a theme\nby name. Example in _examples/azure.go.\n\nThere is a VNC over wbesockets functionality available for X11 backed hosts.\nSee the tk9.0/vnc package for details.\n\nPackage initialization is done lazily. This saves noticeable additional\nstartup time and avoids screen flicker in hybrid programs that use the GUI\nonly on demand.\n\nEarly package initialization can be enforced by Initialize.\n\nInitialization will fail if a Unix process starts on a machine with no\nX server or the process is started in a way that it has no access to the X\nserver. On the other hand, this package may work on Unix machines with no X\nserver if the process is started remotely using '$ ssh -X foo@bar' and the X\nforwarding is enabled/supported.\n\nDarwin port uses the macOS GUI API and does not use X11.\n\nZero or more options can be specified when creating a widget. For example\n\nor\n\nTcl/Tk uses widget pathnames, image and font names explicitly set by user\ncode.  This package generates those names automatically and they are not\ndirectly needed in code that uses this package.\n\nThere is, for a example, a Tcl/tk 'text' widget and a '-text' option. This\npackage exports the widget as type 'TextWidget', its constructor as function\n'Text' and the option as function 'Txt'. The complete list is:\n\nThis package should be used from the same goroutine that initialized the\npackage. Package initialization performs a runtime.LockOSThread, meaning\nfunc main() will start execuing locked on the same OS thread.\n\nThe Command() and similar options expect an argument that must be one of:\n\n- An EventHandler or a function literal of the same signature.\n\n- A func(). This can be used when the handler does not need the associated\nEvent instance.\n\nWhen passing an argument of type time.Durarion to a function accepting\n'any', the duration is converted to an integer number of milliseconds.\n\nWhen passing an argument of type []byte to a function accepting 'any', the\nbyte slice is converted to a encoding/base64 encoded string.\n\nWhen passing an argument of type []FileType to a function accepting 'any',\nthe slice is converted to the representation the Tcl/Tk -filetypes option\nexpects.\n\nAt least some minimal knowledge of reading Tcl/Tk code is probably required\nfor using this package and/or using the related documentation. However you\nwill not need to write any Tcl code and you do not need to care about the\ngrammar of Tcl words/string literals and how it differs from Go.\n\nThere are several Tcl/Tk tutorials available, for example at\ntutorialspoint.\n\nMerge requests for known issues are always welcome.\n\nPlease send merge requests for new features/APIs after filling and\ndiscussing the additions/changes at the issue tracker first.\n\nMost of the documentation is generated directly from the Tcl/Tk\ndocumentation and may not be entirely correct for the Go package. Those\nparts hopefully still serve as a quick/offline Tcl/Tk reference.\n\nParts of the documentation are copied and/or modified from the tcl.tk\nsite, see the LICENSE-TCLTK file for details.\n\nParts

Note that the actual color\nvalues depend on the currently active OS theme.\n\nAdditional system colors available both on macOS and Windows.\n\nError modes\n\nAdditional macOS and Windows cursors.\n\nApp is the main/root application window.\n\nError records errors when CollectErrors is true.\n\nErrorMode selects the action taken on errors.\n\nNativeScaling is the value returned by TKScaling in package initialization before it is possibly\nchanged using the ScaleEnvVar value.\n\nActivateTheme searches Themes to find first theme named like 'name' and\ncall its Activate method. The search is case insensitive, using\nstrings.ToLower, and white space is normalized. If there's no match,\nActivateTheme returns NotFound.\n\nBell — Ring a display's bell\n\nThis command rings the bell on the display for window and returns an empty\nstring. If the -displayof option is omitted, the display of the\napplication's main window is used by default. The command uses the current\nbell-related settings for the display, which may be modified with programs\nsuch as xset.\n\nIf -nice is not specified, this command also resets the screen saver for the\nscreen. Some screen savers will ignore this, but others will reset so that\nthe screen becomes visible again.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk bell page.\n\nbind — Arrange for X events to invoke functions\n\nBind tag options...\n\nThe bind command associates commands with X events. If all three\narguments are specified, bind will arrange for script (a Tcl script called\nthe “binding script”) to be evaluated whenever the event(s) given by\nsequence occur in the window(s) identified by tag. If script is prefixed\nwith a “+”, then it is appended to any existing binding for sequence;\notherwise script replaces any existing binding. If script is an empty string\nthen the current binding for sequence is destroyed, leaving sequence\nunbound. In all of the cases where a script argument is provided, bind\nreturns an empty string.\n\nIf sequence is specified without a script, then the script currently bound\nto sequence is returned, or an empty string is returned if there is no\nbinding for sequence. If neither sequence nor script is specified, then the\nreturn value is a list whose elements are all the sequences for which there\nexist bindings for tag.\n\nThe tag argument determines which window(s) the binding applies to. If tag\nbegins with a dot, as in .a.b.c, then it must be the path name for a window;\notherwise it may be an arbitrary string. Each window has an associated list\nof tags, and a binding applies to a particular window if its tag is among\nthose specified for the window. Although the bindtags command may be used to\nassign an arbitrary set of binding tags to a window, the default binding\ntags provide the following behavior:\n\nExample usage in _examples/events.go.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk bind page.\n\nChooseColor — pops up a dialog box for the user to select a color.\n\nChooseColor pops up a dialog box for the user to select a color. The\nfollowing option-value pairs are possible as command line arguments:\n\nSpecifies the color to display in the color dialog when it pops up. color\nmust be in a form acceptable to the Tk_GetColor function.\n\nMakes window the logical parent of the color dialog. The color dialog is\ndisplayed on top of its parent window.\n\nSpecifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this option\nis not specified, then a default title will be displayed.\n\nIf the user selects a color, ChooseColor will return the name of the\ncolor in a form acceptable to Tk_GetColor. If the user cancels the\noperation, both commands will return the empty string.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk choosecolor page.\n\nChooseDirectory — pops up a dialog box for the user to select a directory.\n\nThe procedure tk_chooseDirectory pops up a dialog box for the user to select\na directory. The following option-value pairs are possible as command line\narguments:\n\nSpecifies that the directories in directory should be displayed when the\ndialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified, the initial directory\ndefaults to the current working directory on non-Windows systems and on\nWindows systems prior to Vista. On Vista and later systems, the initial\ndirectory defaults to the last user-selected directory for the application.\nIf the parameter specifies a relative path, the return value will convert\nthe relative path to an absolute path.\n\nSpecifies a message to include in the client area of the dialog. This is\nonly available on Mac OS X.\n\nSpecifies whether the user may specify non-existent directories. If this\nparameter is true, then the user may only select directories that already\nexist. The default value is false.\n\nMakes window the logical parent of the dialog. The dialog is displayed on\ntop of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this turns the file dialog into a\nsheet attached to the parent window.\n\nSpecifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this option\nis not specified, then a default title will be displayed.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk chooseDirectory page.\n\nClipboardAppend — Manipulate Tk clipboard\n\nThis command provides a Tcl interface to the Tk clipboard, which stores data\nfor later retrieval using the selection mechanism (via the -selection\nCLIPBOARD option). In order to copy data into the clipboard, clipboard clear\nmust be called, followed by a sequence of one or more calls to clipboard\nappend. To ensure that the clipboard is updated atomically, all appends\nshould be completed before returning to the event loop.\n\nClipboardAppend appends 'data' to the clipboard on window's display in the\nform given by type with the representation given by format and claims\nownership of the clipboard on window's display.\n\nDisplayof window\n\nFormat format\n\nThe format argument specifies the representation that should be used to\ntransmit the selection to the requester (the second column of Table 2 of the\nICCCM), and defaults to STRING. If format is STRING, the selection is\ntransmitted as 8-bit ASCII characters. If format is ATOM, then the data is\ndivided into fields separated by white space; each field is converted to its\natom value, and the 32-bit atom value is transmitted instead of the atom\nname. For any other format, data is divided into fields separated by white\nspace and each field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an array of integers\nis transmitted to the selection requester. Note that strings passed to\nclipboard append are concatenated before conversion, so the caller must take\ncare to ensure appropriate spacing across string boundaries. All items\nappended to the clipboard with the same type must have the same format.\n\nThe format argument is needed only for compatibility with clipboard\nrequesters that do not use Tk. If the Tk toolkit is being used to retrieve\nthe CLIPBOARD selection then the value is converted back to a string at the\nrequesting end, so format is irrelevant.\n\nType specifies the form in which the selection is to be returned (the\ndesired “target” for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should be an\natom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME; see the Inter-Client Communication\nConventions Manual for complete details. Type defaults to STRING.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk clipboard page.\n\nClipboardClear — Manipulate Tk clipboard\n\nClaims ownership of the clipboard on window's display and removes any\nprevious contents. Window defaults to App. Returns an empty string.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk clipboard page.\n\nClipboardGet — Manipulate Tk clipboard\n\nRetrieve data from the clipboard on window's display. Window defaults to App.\n\nDisplayof window\n\nType type\n\nType specifies the form in which the data is to be returned and should be an\natom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME. Type defaults to STRING. This command\nis equivalent to [SelectionGet](Selection(\"CLIPBOARD\").\n\nNote that on modern X11 systems, the most useful type to retrieve for\ntransferred strings is not STRING, but rather UTF8_STRING.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk clipboard page.\n\nCourierFont returns \"{courier new}\" on Windows and \"courier\" elsewhere.\n\nCurrentThemeName returns the name of the currently activated theme, if any.\n\nDestroy — Destroy one or more windows\n\nThis command deletes the windows given by the window arguments, plus all of\ntheir descendants. If a window “.” (App) is deleted then all windows will be\ndestroyed and the application will (normally) exit. The windows are\ndestroyed in order, and if an error occurs in destroying a window the\ncommand aborts without destroying the remaining windows. No error is\nreturned if window does not exist.\n\nFinalize releases all resources held, if any. This may include temporary\nfiles. Finalize is intended to be called on process shutdown only.\n\nFocus — Manage the input focus\n\nThe focus command is used to manage the Tk input focus. At any given time,\none window on each display is designated as the focus window; any key press\nor key release events for the display are sent to that window. It is\nnormally up to the window manager to redirect the focus among the top-level\nwindows of a display. For example, some window managers automatically set\nthe input focus to a top-level window whenever the mouse enters it; others\nredirect the input focus only when the user clicks on a window. Usually the\nwindow manager will set the focus only to top-level windows, leaving it up\nto the application to redirect the focus among the children of the\ntop-level.\n\nTk remembers one focus window for each top-level (the most recent descendant\nof that top-level to receive the focus); when the window manager gives the\nfocus to a top-level, Tk automatically redirects it to the remembered\nwindow. Within a top-level Tk uses an explicit focus model by default.\nMoving the mouse within a top-level does not normally change the focus; the\nfocus changes only when a widget decides explicitly to claim the focus\n(e.g., because of a button click), or when the user types a key such as Tab\nthat moves the focus.\n\nThe Tcl procedure tk_focusFollowsMouse may be invoked to create an implicit\nfocus model: it reconfigures Tk so that the focus is set to a window\nwhenever the mouse enters it. The Tcl procedures tk_focusNext and\ntk_focusPrev implement a focus order among the windows of a top-level; they\nare used in the default bindings for Tab and Shift-Tab, among other things.\n\nThe focus command can take any of the following forms:\n\nReturns the path name of the focus window on the display containing the\napplication's main window, or an empty string if no window in this\napplication has the focus on that display. Note: it is better to specify the\ndisplay explicitly using -displayof (see below) so that the code will work\nin applications using multiple displays.\n\nIf the application currently has the input focus on window's display, this\ncommand resets the input focus for window's display to window and returns an\nempty string. If the application does not currently have the input focus on\nwindow's display, window will be remembered as the focus for its top-level;\nthe next time the focus arrives at the top-level, Tk will redirect it to\nwindow. If window is an empty string then the command does nothing.\n\nReturns the name of the focus window on the display containing window. If\nthe focus window for window's display is not in this application, the return\nvalue is an empty string.\n\nSets the focus of window's display to window, even if the application does\nnot currently have the input focus for the display. This command should be\nused sparingly, if at all. In normal usage, an application should not claim\nthe focus for itself; instead, it should wait for the window manager to give\nit the focus. If window is an empty string then the command does nothing.\n\nReturns the name of the most recent window to have the input focus among all\nthe windows in the same top-level as window. If no window in that top-level\nhas ever had the input focus, or if the most recent focus window has been\ndeleted, then the name of the top-level is returned. The return value is the\nwindow that will receive the input focus the next time the window manager\ngives the focus to the top-level.\n\nWhen an internal window receives the input focus, Tk does not actually set\nthe X focus to that window; as far as X is concerned, the focus will stay on\nthe top-level window containing the window with the focus. However, Tk\ngenerates FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the X focus were on the\ninternal window. This approach gets around a number of problems that would\noccur if the X focus were actually moved; the fact that the X focus is on\nthe top-level is invisible unless you use C code to query the X server\ndirectly.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk focus page.\n\nfont — Create and inspect fonts.\n\nQuery or modify the desired attributes for the named font called fontname.\nIf no option is specified, returns a list describing all the options and\ntheir values for fontname. If a single option is specified with no value,\nthen returns the current value of that attribute. If one or more\noption-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given named\nfont to have the given values; in this case, all widgets using that font\nwill redisplay themselves using the new attributes for the font. See FONT\nOPTIONS below for a list of the possible attributes.\n\nNote that on Aqua/macOS, the system fonts (see PLATFORM SPECIFIC FONTS\nbelow) may not be actually altered because they are implemented by the\nsystem theme. To achieve the effect of modification, use font actual to get\ntheir configuration and font create to synthesize a copy of the font which\ncan be modified.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk font page.\n\nFontFamilies — Create and inspect fonts.\n\nThe return value is a list of the case-insensitive names of all font\nfamilies that exist on window's display. If the Displayof argument is\nomitted, it defaults to the main window.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk font page.\n\nFontchooser — control font selection dialog\n\nThe tk fontchooser command controls the Tk font selection dialog. It uses\nthe native platform font selection dialog where available, or a dialog\nimplemented in Tcl otherwise.\n\nUnlike most of the other Tk dialog commands, tk fontchooser does not return\nan immediate result, as on some platforms (Mac OS X) the standard font\ndialog is modeless while on others (Windows) it is modal. To get the\nuser-selected font use FontchooserFont() from a handler assigned via\nCommand.\n\nSet one or more of the configurations options below (analogous to Tk widget configuration).\n\nSpecifies/returns the logical parent window of the font selection dialog\n(similar to the -parent option to other dialogs). The font selection dialog\nis hidden if it is visible when the parent window is destroyed.\n\nSpecifies/returns the title of the dialog. Has no effect on platforms where\nthe font selection dialog does not support titles.\n\nSpecifies/returns the font that is currently selected in the dialog if it is\nvisible, or that will be initially selected when the dialog is shown (if\nsupported by the platform). Can be set to the empty string to indicate that\nno font should be selected. Fonts can be specified in any form given by the\n\"FONT DESCRIPTION\" section in the font manual page.\n\nSpecifies the command called when a font selection has been made by the\nuser. To obtain the font description, call FontchooserFont from the\nhandler.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk fontchooser page.\n\nFontchooserFont — control font selection dialog\n\nReturns the selected font description in the form\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk fontchooser page.\n\nFontchooserHide — control font selection dialog\n\nHide the font selection dialog if it is visible and cause any pending tk\nfontchooser show command to return.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk fontchooser page.\n\nFontchooserShow — control font selection dialog\n\nShow the font selection dialog. Depending on the platform, may return\nimmediately or only once the dialog has been withdrawn.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk fontchooser page.\n\nGetOpenFile — pop up a dialog box for the user to select a file to open.\n\nGetOpenFile pops up a dialog box for the user to select a file to open. The\nfunction is usually associated with the Open command in the File menu. Its\npurpose is for the user to select an existing file only. If the user enters\na non-existent file, the dialog box gives the user an error prompt and\nrequires the user to give an alternative selection. If an application allows\nthe user to create new files, it should do so by providing a separate New\nmenu command.\n\nSpecifies a string that will be appended to the filename if the user enters\na filename without an extension. The default value is the empty string,\nwhich means no extension will be appended to the filename in any case. This\noption is ignored on Mac OS X, which does not require extensions to\nfilenames, and the UNIX implementation guesses reasonable values for this\nfrom the -filetypes option when this is not supplied.\n\nIf a File types listbox exists in the file dialog on the particular\nplatform, this option gives the filetypes in this listbox. When the user\nchoose a filetype in the listbox, only the files of that type are listed. If\nthis option is unspecified, or if it is set to the empty list, or if the\nFile types listbox is not supported by the particular platform then all\nfiles are listed regardless of their types. See the section SPECIFYING FILE\nPATTERNS below for a discussion on the contents of filePatternList.\n\nSpecifies that the files in directory should be displayed when the dialog\npops up. If this parameter is not specified, the initial directory defaults\nto the current working directory on non-Windows systems and on Windows\nsystems prior to Vista. On Vista and later systems, the initial directory\ndefaults to the last user-selected directory for the application. If the\nparameter specifies a relative path, the return value will convert the\nrelative path to an absolute path.\n\nSpecifies a filename to be displayed in the dialog when it pops up.\n\nAllows the user to choose multiple files from the Open dialog.\n\nMakes window the logical parent of the file dialog. The file dialog is\ndisplayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this turns the file\ndialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.\n\nSpecifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this option\nis not specified, then a default title is displayed.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk getopenfile page.\n\nGetSaveFile — pop up a dialog box for the user to select a file to save.\n\nGetSaveFile pops up a dialog box for the user to select a file to save.\n\nThe functio is usually associated with the Save as command in the File menu.\nIf the user enters a file that already exists, the dialog box prompts the\nuser for confirmation whether the existing file should be overwritten or\nnot.\n\nConfigures how the Save dialog reacts when the selected file already exists,\nand saving would overwrite it. A true value requests a confirmation dialog\nbe presented to the user. A false value requests that the overwrite take\nplace without confirmation. Default value is true.\n\nSpecifies a string that will be appended to the filename if the user enters\na filename without an extension. The default value is the empty string,\nwhich means no extension will be appended to the filename in any case. This\noption is ignored on Mac OS X, which does not require extensions to\nfilenames, and the UNIX implementation guesses reasonable values for this\nfrom the -filetypes option when this is not supplied.\n\nIf a File types listbox exists in the file dialog on the particular\nplatform, this option gives the filetypes in this listbox. When the user\nchoose a filetype in the listbox, only the files of that type are listed. If\nthis option is unspecified, or if it is set to the empty list, or if the\nFile types listbox is not supported by the particular platform then all\nfiles are listed regardless of their types. See the section SPECIFYING FILE\nPATTERNS below for a discussion on the contents of filePatternList.\n\nSpecifies that the files in directory should be displayed when the dialog\npops up. If this parameter is not specified, the initial directory defaults\nto the current working directory on non-Windows systems and on Windows\nsystems prior to Vista. On Vista and later systems, the initial directory\ndefaults to the last user-selected directory for the application. If the\nparameter specifies a relative path, the return value will convert the\nrelative path to an absolute path.\n\nSpecifies a filename to be displayed in the dialog when it pops up.\n\nMakes window the logical parent of the file dialog. The file dialog is\ndisplayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this turns the file\ndialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.\n\nSpecifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this option\nis not specified, then a default title is displayed.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk getopenfile page.\n\nGrid — Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid\n\nThe arguments consist of the names of one or more content windows followed\nby pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the content. The characters\n-, x and ^, can be specified instead of a window name to alter the default\nlocation of a window, as described in the RELATIVE PLACEMENT section, below.\n\nThe following options are supported:\n\nInsert the window so that it occupies the nth column in the grid. Column\nnumbers start with 0. If this option is not supplied, then the window is\narranged just to the right of previous window specified on this call to\ngrid, or column “0” if it is the first window. For each x that immediately\nprecedes the window, the column position is incremented by one. Thus the x\nrepresents a blank column for this row in the grid.\n\nInsert the window so that it occupies n columns in the grid. The default is\none column, unless the window name is followed by a -, in which case the\ncolumnspan is incremented once for each immediately following -.\n\nInsert the window(s) in the container window given by container. The default\nis the first window's parent window.\n\nThe amount specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave on each\nside of the content. This is space is added inside the content border. The\namount must be a valid screen distance, such as 2 or .5c. It defaults to 0.\n\nThe amount specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on the top\nand bottom of the content. This space is added inside the content border.\nThe amount defaults to 0.\n\nThe amount specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave on each\nside of the content, in screen units. Amount may be a list of two values to\nspecify padding for left and right separately. The amount defaults to 0.\nThis space is added outside the content border.\n\nThe amount specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on the top\nand bottom of the content, in screen units. Amount may be a list of two\nvalues to specify padding for top and bottom separately. The amount defaults\nto 0. This space is added outside the content border.\n\nInsert the content so that it occupies the nth row in the grid. Row numbers\nstart with 0. If this option is not supplied, then the content is arranged\non the same row as the previous content specified on this call to grid, or\nthe next row after the highest occupied row if this is the first content.\n\nInsert the content so that it occupies n rows in the grid. The default is\none row. If the next grid command contains ^ characters instead of content\nthat line up with the columns of this content, then the rowspan of this\ncontent is extended by one.\n\nIf a content's cell is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may\nbe used to position (or stretch) the content within its cell. Style is a\nstring that contains zero or more of the characters n, s, e or w. The string\ncan optionally contain spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each letter\nrefers to a side (north, south, east, or west) that the content will “stick”\nto. If both n and s (or e and w) are specified, the content will be\nstretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its cavity. The -sticky\noption subsumes the combination of -anchor and -fill that is used by pack.\nThe default is “”, which causes the content to be centered in its cavity, at\nits requested size.\n\nIf any of the content is already managed by the geometry manager then any\nunspecified options for them retain their previous values rather than\nreceiving default values.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk grid page.\n\nGrid — Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid\n\nThe anchor value controls how to place the grid within the container window\nwhen no row/column has any weight. See THE GRID ALGORITHM below for further\ndetails. The default anchor is nw.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk grid page.\n\nGrid — Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid\n\nQuery or set the column properties of the index column of the geometry\ncontainer, window. The valid options are -minsize, -weight, -uniform and\n-pad. If one or more options are provided, then index may be given as a list\nof column indices to which the configuration options will operate on.\nIndices may be integers, window names or the keyword all. For all the\noptions apply to all columns currently occupied be content windows. For a\nwindow name, that window must be a content of this container and the options\napply to all columns currently occupied be the content. The -minsize option\nsets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this\ncolumn. The -weight option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for\napportioning any extra spaces among columns. A weight of zero (0) indicates\nthe column will not deviate from its requested size. A column whose weight\nis two will grow at twice the rate as a column of weight one when extra\nspace is allocated to the layout. The -uniform option, when a non-empty\nvalue is supplied, places the column in a uniform group with other columns\nthat have the same value for -uniform. The space for columns belonging to a\nuniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in strict\nproportion to their -weight values. See THE GRID ALGORITHM below for further\ndetails. The -pad option specifies the number of screen units that will be\nadded to the largest window contained completely in that column when the\ngrid geometry manager requests a size from the containing window. If only an\noption is specified, with no value, the current value of that option is\nreturned. If only the container window and index is specified, all the\ncurrent settings are returned in a list of “-option value” pairs.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk grid page.\n\nGrid — Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid\n\nQuery or set the row properties of the index row of the geometry container,\nwindow.

The function may panic if ErrorMode is PanicOnError.\n\ntk_messageBox — pops up a message window and waits for user response.\n\nThis procedure creates and displays a message window with an\napplication-specified message, an icon and a set of buttons. Each of the\nbuttons in the message window is identified by a unique symbolic name (see\nthe -type options). After the message window is popped up, tk_messageBox\nwaits for the user to select one of the buttons. Then it returns the\nsymbolic name of the selected button.  The following optins are\nsupported:\n\nSpecifies the handler to invoke when the user closes the\ndialog. The actual command consists of string followed by a space and the\nname of the button clicked by the user to close the dialog. This is only\navailable on Mac OS X.\n\nName gives the symbolic name of the default button for this message window (\n“ok”, “cancel”, and so on). See -type for a list of the symbolic names. If\nthis option is not specified, the first button in the dialog will be made\nthe default.\n\nSpecifies an auxiliary message to the main message given by the -message\noption. The message detail will be presented beneath the main message and,\nwhere supported by the OS, in a less emphasized font than the main message.\n\nSpecifies an icon to display. IconImage must be one of the following: error,\ninfo, question or warning. If this option is not specified, then the info\nicon will be displayed.\n\nSpecifies the message to display in this message box. The default value is\nan empty string.\n\nMakes window the logical parent of the message box. The message box is\ndisplayed on top of its parent window.\n\nSpecifies a string to display as the title of the message box. The default\nvalue is an empty string.\n\nArranges for a predefined set of buttons to be displayed. The following\nvalues are possible for predefinedType:\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk messageBox page.\n\nPack — Geometry manager that packs around edges of cavity\n\nThe options consist of one or more content windows followed\nby options that specify how to manage the content. See THE PACKER\nALGORITHM for details on how the options are used by the packer.\n\nThe first argument must be a *Window.\n\nThe following options are supported:\n\nOther must the name of another window. Use its container as the container\nfor the content, and insert the content just after other in the packing\norder.\n\nAnchor must be a valid anchor position such as n or sw; it specifies where\nto position each content in its parcel. Defaults to center.\n\nOther must the name of another window. Use its container as the container\nfor the content, and insert the content just before other in the packing\norder.\n\nSpecifies whether the content should be expanded to consume extra space in\ntheir container. Boolean may have any proper boolean value, such as 1 or no.\nDefaults to 0.\n\nIf a content's parcel is larger than its requested dimensions, this option\nmay be used to stretch the content. Style must have one of the following\nvalues:\n\n.\n\nInsert the window at the end of the packing order for the container window\ngiven by container.\n\nAmount specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave on each side\nof the content. Amount must be a valid screen distance, such as 2 or .5c. It\ndefaults to 0.\n\nAmount specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on each side of\nthe content. Amount defaults to 0.\n\nAmount specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave on each side\nof the content. Amount may be a list of two values to specify padding for\nleft and right separately. Amount defaults to 0.\n\nAmount specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on each side of\nthe content. Amount may be a list of two values to specify padding for top\nand bottom separately. Amount defaults to 0.\n\nSpecifies which side of the container the content will be packed against.\nMust be \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", or \"bottom\". Defaults to top.\n\nIf no -in, -after or -before option is specified then each of the content\nwill be inserted at the end of the packing list for its parent unless it is\nalready managed by the packer (in which case it will be left where it is).\nIf one of these options is specified then all the content will be inserted\nat the specified point. If any of the content are already managed by the\ngeometry manager then any unspecified options for them retain their previous\nvalues rather than receiving default values.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk pack page.\n\nPlace — Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement\n\nThe placer is a geometry manager for Tk. It provides simple fixed placement\nof windows, where you specify the exact size and location of one window,\ncalled the content, within another window, called the container. The placer\nalso provides rubber-sheet placement, where you specify the size and\nlocation of the content in terms of the dimensions of the container, so that\nthe content changes size and location in response to changes in the size of\nthe container. Lastly, the placer allows you to mix these styles of\nplacement so that, for example, the content has a fixed width and height but\nis centered inside the container.\n\nThe first argument must be a *Window.\n\nThe following options are supported:\n\nWhere specifies which point of window is to be positioned at the (x,y)\nlocation selected by the -x, -y, -relx, and -rely options. The anchor point\nis in terms of the outer area of window including its border, if any. Thus\nif where is se then the lower-right corner of window's border will appear at\nthe given (x,y) location in the container. The anchor position defaults to\nnw.\n\nMode determines the degree to which borders within the container are used in\ndetermining the placement of the content. The default and most common value\nis inside. In this case the placer considers the area of the container to be\nthe innermost area of the container, inside any border: an option of -x 0\ncorresponds to an x-coordinate just inside the border and an option of\n-relwidth 1.0 means window will fill the area inside the container's border.\n\nIf mode is outside then the placer considers the area of the container to\ninclude its border; this mode is typically used when placing window outside\nits container, as with the options -x 0 -y 0 -anchor ne. Lastly, mode may be\nspecified as ignore, in which case borders are ignored: the area of the\ncontainer is considered to be its official X area, which includes any\ninternal border but no external border. A bordermode of ignore is probably\nnot very useful.\n\nSize specifies the height for window in screen units (i.e. any of the forms\naccepted by Tk_GetPixels). The height will be the outer dimension of window\nincluding its border, if any. If size is an empty string, or if no -height\nor -relheight option is specified, then the height requested internally by\nthe window will be used.\n\nContainer specifies the path name of the window relative to which window is\nto be placed. Container must either be window's parent or a descendant of\nwindow's parent. In addition, container and window must both be descendants\nof the same top-level window. These restrictions are necessary to guarantee\nthat window is visible whenever container is visible. If this option is not\nspecified then the other window defaults to window's parent.\n\nSize specifies the height for window. In this case the height is specified\nas a floating-point number relative to the height of the container: 0.5\nmeans window will be half as high as the container, 1.0 means window will\nhave the same height as the container, and so on. If both -height and\n-relheight are specified for a content, their values are summed. For\nexample, -relheight 1.0 -height -2 makes the content 2 pixels shorter than\nthe container.\n\nSize specifies the width for window. In this case the width is specified as\na floating-point number relative to the width of the container: 0.5 means\nwindow will be half as wide as the container, 1.0 means window will have the\nsame width as the container, and so on. If both -width and -relwidth are\nspecified for a content, their values are summed. For example, -relwidth 1.0\n-width 5 makes the content 5 pixels wider than the container.\n\nLocation specifies the x-coordinate within the container window of the\nanchor point for window. In this case the location is specified in a\nrelative fashion as a floating-point number: 0.0 corresponds to the left\nedge of the container and 1.0 corresponds to the right edge of the\ncontainer. Location need not be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both -x and -relx\nare specified for a content then their values are summed. For example, -relx\n0.5 -x -2 positions the left edge of the content 2 pixels to the left of the\ncenter of its container.\n\nLocation specifies the y-coordinate within the container window of the\nanchor point for window. In this case the value is specified in a relative\nfashion as a floating-point number: 0.0 corresponds to the top edge of the\ncontainer and 1.0 corresponds to the bottom edge of the container. Location\nneed not be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both -y and -rely are specified for a\ncontent then their values are summed. For example, -rely 0.5 -x 3 positions\nthe top edge of the content 3 pixels below the center of its container.\n\nSize specifies the width for window in screen units (i.e. any of the forms\naccepted by Tk_GetPixels). The width will be the outer width of window\nincluding its border, if any. If size is an empty string, or if no -width or\n-relwidth option is specified, then the width requested internally by the\nwindow will be used.\n\nLocation specifies the x-coordinate within the container window of the\nanchor point for window. The location is specified in screen units (i.e. any\nof the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixels) and need not lie within the bounds of\nthe container window.\n\nLocation specifies the y-coordinate within the container window of the\nanchor point for window. The location is specified in screen units (i.e. any\nof the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixels) and need not lie within the bounds of\nthe container window.\n\nIf the same value is specified separately with two different options, such\nas -x and -relx, then the most recent option is used and the older one is\nignored.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk place page.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nSets the default value of the specified option(s) in style. If style does\nnot exist, it is created. Example:\n\nIf only style and -option are specified, get the default value for option\n-option of style style. Example:\n\nIf only style is specified, get the default value for all options of style\nstyle. Example:\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nCreates a new element in the current theme of type type. The only\ncross-platform built-in element type is image (see ttk_image(n)) but themes\nmay define other element types (see Ttk_RegisterElementFactory). On suitable\nversions of Windows an element factory is registered to create Windows theme\nelements (see ttk_vsapi(n)). Examples:\n\nAfter the type \"image\" comes a list of one or more images. Every image is\noptionally followed by a space separated list of states the image applies\nto. An exclamation mark before the state is a negation.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk modifying a button\nand Tcl/Tk style pages.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nReturns the list of elements defined in the current theme.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nReturns the list of element's options.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nDefine the widget layout for style style. See LAYOUTS below for the format\nof layoutSpec. If layoutSpec is omitted, return the layout specification for\nstyle style. Example:\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk modifying a button\nand Tcl/Tk style pages.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nReturns the value specified for -option in style style in state state, using\nthe standard lookup rules for element options. state is a list of state\nnames; if omitted, it defaults to all bits off (the “normal” state). If the\ndefault argument is present, it is used as a fallback value in case no\nspecification for -option is found. If style does not exist, it is created.\nFor example,\n\nmay return \"TkDefaultFont\", depending on the operating system, theme in use\nand the configured style options.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nSets dynamic (state dependent) values of the specified option(s) in style.\nEach statespec / value pair is examined in order; the value corresponding to\nthe first matching statespec is used. If style does not exist, it is\ncreated. If only style and -option are specified, get the dynamic values for\noption -option of style style. If only style is specified, get the dynamic\nvalues for all options of style 'style'.\n\nWith no options the function returns the currently configured style map for\n'style'.  For example,\n\nmay return \"-relief {{!disabled pressed} sunken}\", depending on the\noperating system, theme in use and the configured style options.\n\nSetting a style map is done by providing a list of options, each option is\nfollowed by a list of states and a value. For example:\n\nThe widget state is a bitmap of independent state flags.\n\nA state specification is a sequence of state names, optionally prefixed with\nan exclamation point indicating that the bit is off.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nReturns a list of all known themes.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nReturns a list of all styles in themeName. If themeName is omitted, the\ncurrent theme is used.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\n\nttk::style — Manipulate style database\n\nWithout a argument the result is the name of the current theme. Otherwise\nthis command sets the current theme to themeName, and refreshes all widgets.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk style page.\nThere's also a Styles and Themes tutorial at tkdoc.com.\n\nTeX is like Tex2 but report errors using ErrorMode and Error.\n\nTeX2 renders TeX 'src' as a png file that shows the TeX \"snippet\" in a fixed\n600 dpi resolution. The result is afterwards resized using the 'scale'\nfactor. Scale factor 1.0 means no resize.\n\nOnly plain Tex and a subset of some of the default Computer Modern fonts are\nsupported. Many small fonts are not available.\n\nTeXImg renders is line TeX but returns an image.Image.\n\nTeXImg2 renders is line TeX2 but returns an image.Image.\n\ntk — Manipulate Tk internal state\n\nSets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to convert between\nphysical units (for example, points, inches, or millimeters) and pixels. The\nnumber argument is a floating point number that specifies the number of\npixels per point on window's display. If the window argument is omitted, it\ndefaults to the main window. If the number argument is omitted, the current\nvalue of the scaling factor is returned.\n\nA “point” is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch. A scaling factor of\n1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is equivalent to a standard 72\ndpi monitor. A scaling factor of 1.25 would mean 1.25 pixels per point,\nwhich is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor to\n1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the application to be\ndisplayed 1.25 times as large as normal. The initial value for the scaling\nfactor is set when the application starts, based on properties of the\ninstalled monitor, but it can be changed at any time. Measurements made\nafter the scaling factor is changed will use the new scaling factor, but it\nis undefined whether existing widgets will resize themselves dynamically to\naccommodate the new scaling factor.\n\n- Displayof window\n\n- Number\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk tk page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nPrevents the specified widgets from showing tooltips. pattern is a glob\npattern and defaults to matching all widgets.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nQueries or modifies the configuration options of the tooltip. The supported\noptions are -backgroud, -foreground and -font. If one option is specified with\nno value, returns the value of that option. Otherwise, sets the given\noptions to the corresponding values.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nQuery or set the hover delay. This is the interval that the pointer must\nremain over the widget before the tooltip is displayed. The delay is\nspecified in milliseconds and must be greater than or equal to 50 ms. With\na negative argument the current delay is returned.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nEnable or disable fading of the tooltip. The fading is enabled by default on\nWin32 and Aqua. The tooltip will fade away on Leave events instead\ndisappearing.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nEnables tooltips for defined widgets.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\nUpdate — Process pending events and idle callbacks\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk update page.\n\nwinfo — Return window-related information\n\nReturns a decimal string giving window's height in pixels. When a window is\nfirst created its height will be 1 pixel; the height will eventually be\nchanged by a geometry manager to fulfil the window's needs. If you need the\ntrue height immediately after creating a widget, invoke update to force the\ngeometry manager to arrange it, or use winfo reqheight to get the window's\nrequested height instead of its actual height.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk winfo page.\n\nwinfo — Return window-related information\n\nReturns a decimal string giving the height of window's screen, in pixels.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk winfo page.\n\nwinfo — Return window-related information\n\nReturns a decimal string giving the width of window's screen, in pixels.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk winfo page.\n\nwinfo — Return window-related information\n\nReturns a decimal string giving window's width in pixels.

Otherwise the current geometry for window is\nreturned (this is the most recent geometry specified either by manual\nresizing or in a wm geometry command). NewGeometry has the form\n=widthxheight±x±y, where any of =, widthxheight, or ±x±y may be omitted.\nWidth and height are positive integers specifying the desired dimensions of\nwindow. If window is gridded (see GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT below) then\nthe dimensions are specified in grid units; otherwise they are specified in\npixel units.\n\nX and y specify the desired location of window on the screen, in pixels. If\nx is preceded by +, it specifies the number of pixels between the left edge\nof the screen and the left edge of window's border; if preceded by - then x\nspecifies the number of pixels between the right edge of the screen and the\nright edge of window's border. If y is preceded by + then it specifies the\nnumber of pixels between the top of the screen and the top of window's\nborder; if y is preceded by - then it specifies the number of pixels between\nthe bottom of window's border and the bottom of the screen.\n\nIf newGeometry is specified as an empty string then any existing\nuser-specified geometry for window is cancelled, and the window will revert\nto the size requested internally by its widgets.\n\nNote that this is related to winfo geometry, but not the same. That can only\nquery the geometry, and always reflects Tk's current understanding of the\nactual size and location of window, whereas wm geometry allows both setting\nand querying of the window manager's understanding of the size and location\nof the window. This can vary significantly, for example to reflect the\naddition of decorative elements to window such as title bars, and window\nmanagers are not required to precisely follow the requests made through this\ncommand.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nwm — Communicate with window manager\n\nReturns the  maximum width and height currently in effect. The maximum size defaults to\nthe size of the screen. See the sections on geometry management below for\nmore information.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nwm — Communicate with window manager\n\nIf width and height are specified, they give the minimum permissible\ndimensions for window. For gridded windows the dimensions are specified in\ngrid units; otherwise they are specified in pixel units. The window manager\nwill restrict the window's dimensions to be greater than or equal to width\nand height. If width and height are specified, then the command returns an\nempty string. Otherwise it returns a Tcl list with two elements, which are\nthe minimum width and height currently in effect. The minimum size defaults\nto one pixel in each dimension. See the sections on geometry management\nbelow for more information.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nwm — Communicate with window manager\n\nThis command is used to manage window manager protocols. The name argument\nin the wm protocol command is the name of an atom corresponding to a window\nmanager protocol. Examples include WM_DELETE_WINDOW or WM_SAVE_YOURSELF or\nWM_TAKE_FOCUS.  A window manager protocol is a class of messages sent from a\nwindow manager to a Tk application outside of the normal event processing\nsystem. The main example is the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol; these messages\nare sent when the user clicks the close widget in the title bar of a window.\nHandlers for window manager protocols are installed with the wm protocol\ncommand. As a rule, if no handler has been installed for a protocol by the\nwm protocol command then all messages of that protocol are ignored. The\nWM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol is an exception to this rule. At start-up Tk\ninstalls a handler for this protocol, which responds by destroying the\nwindow. The wm protocol command can be used to replace this default handler\nby one which responds differently.\n\nThe list of available window manager protocols depends on the window\nmanager, but all window managers supported by Tk provide WM_DELETE_WINDOW.\nOn the Windows platform, a WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message is sent on user logout\nor system restart.\n\nIf both name and command are specified, then command becomes the handler for\nthe protocol specified by name. The atom for name will be added to window's\nWM_PROTOCOLS property to tell the window manager that the application has a\nhandler for the protocol specified by name, and command will be invoked in\nthe future whenever the window manager sends a message of that protocol to\nthe Tk application. In this case the wm protocol command returns an empty\nstring. If name is specified but command is not (is nil), then the current\nhandler for name is returned, or an empty string if there is no handler\ndefined for name (as a special case, the default handler for\nWM_DELETE_WINDOW is not returned). If command is specified as an empty\nstring then the atom for name is removed from the WM_PROTOCOLS property of\nwindow and the handler is destroyed; an empty string is returned. Lastly, if\nneither name nor command is specified, the wm protocol command returns a\nlist of all of the protocols for which handlers are currently defined for\nwindow.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nwm — Communicate with window manager\n\nWidth and height give the maximum permissible\ndimensions for window. For gridded windows the dimensions are specified in\ngrid units; otherwise they are specified in pixel units. The window manager\nwill restrict the window's dimensions to be less than or equal to width and\nheight. If width and height are specified, then the command returns an empty\nstring. Otherwise it returns a Tcl list with two elements, which are the\nmaximum width and height currently in effect. The maximum size defaults to\nthe size of the screen. See the sections on geometry management below for\nmore information.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nButtonWidget represents the Tcl/Tk button widget/window\n\nButton — Create and manipulate 'button' action widgets\n\nThe button command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a button widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the button such as its colors, font,\ntext, and initial relief.  The button command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA button is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.\nIf text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it\ncan occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines\nor if wrapping occurs because of the -wraplength option) and\none of the characters may optionally be underlined using the\nIt can display itself in either of three different ways, according\nto\nthe -state option;\nit can be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat;\nand it can be made to flash.  When a user invokes the\nbutton (by pressing mouse button 1 with the cursor over the\nbutton), then the Tcl command specified in the -command\noption is invoked.\n\nUse Window.Button to create a Button with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk button page.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies a Tcl command to associate with the button.  This command\nis typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button\nwindow.\n\nDefault\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the default ring: normal,\nactive, or disabled.  In active state, the button is drawn\nwith the platform specific appearance for a default button.  In normal\nstate, the button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a\nnon-default button, leaving enough space to draw the default button\nappearance.  The normal and active states will result in buttons of\nthe same size.  In disabled state, the button is drawn with the\nnon-default button appearance without leaving space for the default\nappearance.  The disabled state may result in a smaller button than\nthe active state.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired height for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in lines of text.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nOverrelief\n\nSpecifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the\nmouse cursor is over the widget.  This option can be used to make\ntoolbar buttons, by configuring -relief flat -overrelief\nraised.  If the value of this option is the empty string, then no\nalternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the button.\nThe empty string is the default value.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the button:  normal, active,\nor disabled.  In normal state the button is displayed using the\n-foreground and -background options.  The active state is\ntypically used when the pointer is over the button.  In active state\nthe button is displayed using the -activeforeground and\n-activebackground options.  Disabled state means that the button\nshould be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate\nthe widget and will ignore mouse button presses.\nIn this state the -disabledforeground and\n-background options determine how the button is displayed.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired width for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels).\nFor a text button (no image or with -compound none) then the width\nspecifies how much space in characters to allocate for the text label.\nIf the width is negative then this specifies a minimum width.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired width is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nExit provides a canned Button with default Txt \"Exit\", bound to the\nExitHandler.\n\nUse Window.Exit to create a Exit with a particular parent.\n\nbutton — Create and manipulate 'button' action widgets\n\nInvoke the Tcl command associated with the button, if there is one. The\nreturn value is the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if\nthere is no command associated with the button. This command is ignored if\nthe button's state is disabled.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk button page.\n\nCanvasWidget represents the Tcl/Tk canvas widget/window\n\nCanvas — Create and manipulate 'canvas' hypergraphics drawing surface widgets\n\nUse Window.Canvas to create a Canvas with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk canvas page.\n\nCloseenough\n\nSpecifies a floating-point value indicating how close the mouse cursor\nmust be to an item before it is considered to be\nthe item. Defaults to 1.0.\n\nConfine\n\nSpecifies a boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be\nallowable to set the canvas's view outside the region defined by the\nscrollRegion argument.\nDefaults to true, which means that the view will\nbe constrained within the scroll region.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired window height that the canvas widget should request from\nits geometry manager. The value may be specified in any\nof the forms described in the COORDINATES section below.\n\nScrollregion\n\nSpecifies a list with four coordinates describing the left, top, right, and\nbottom coordinates of a rectangular region.\nThis region is used for scrolling purposes and is considered to be\nthe boundary of the information in the canvas.\nEach of the coordinates may be specified\nin any of the forms given in the COORDINATES section below.\n\nState\n\nModifies the default state of the canvas where state may be set to\none of: normal, disabled, or hidden. Individual canvas\nobjects all have their own state option which may override the default\nstate. Many options can take separate specifications such that the\nappearance of the item can be different in different situations. The\noptions that start with active control the appearance when the mouse\npointer is over it, while the option starting with disabled controls\nthe appearance when the state is disabled. Canvas items which are\ndisabled will not react to canvas bindings.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired window width that the canvas widget should request from\nits geometry manager. The value may be specified in any\nof the forms described in the COORDINATES section below.\n\nXscrollincrement\n\nSpecifies an increment for horizontal scrolling, in any of the usual forms\npermitted for screen distances. If the value of this option is greater\nthan zero, the horizontal view in the window will be constrained so that\nthe canvas x coordinate at the left edge of the window is always an even\nmultiple of xScrollIncrement; furthermore, the units for scrolling\n(e.g., the change in view when the left and right arrows of a scrollbar\nare selected) will also be xScrollIncrement. If the value of\nthis option is negative or zero, then horizontal scrolling\nis unconstrained.\n\nYscrollincrement\n\nSpecifies an increment for vertical scrolling, in any of the usual forms\npermitted for screen distances. If the value of this option is greater\nthan zero, the vertical view in the window will be constrained so that\nthe canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is always an even\nmultiple of yScrollIncrement; furthermore, the units for scrolling\n(e.g., the change in view when the top and bottom arrows of a scrollbar\nare selected) will also be yScrollIncrement. If the value of\nthis option is negative or zero, then vertical scrolling\nis unconstrained.\n\nGraph — use gnuplot to draw on a canvas. Graph returns 'w'.\n\nThe 'script' argument is passed to a gnuplot executable, which must be\ninstalled on the machine.  See the gnuplot site for documentation about\nproducing graphs. The script must not use the 'set term \u003cdevice\u003e' command.\n\nCheckbuttonWidget represents the Tcl/Tk checkbutton widget/window\n\nCheckbutton — Create and manipulate 'checkbutton' boolean selection widgets\n\nThe checkbutton command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a checkbutton widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the checkbutton such as its colors, font,\ntext, and initial relief.  The checkbutton command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA checkbutton is a widget\nthat displays a textual string, bitmap or image\nand a square called an indicator.\nIf text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it\ncan occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines\nor if wrapping occurs because of the -wraplength option) and\none of the characters may optionally be underlined using the\nA checkbutton has\nall of the behavior of a simple button, including the\nfollowing: it can display itself in either of three different\nways, according to the -state option;\nit can be made to appear\nraised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes\na Tcl command whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the\ncheckbutton.\n\nIn addition, checkbuttons can be selected.\nIf a checkbutton is selected then the indicator is normally\ndrawn with a selected appearance, and\na Tcl variable associated with the checkbutton is set to a particular\nvalue (normally 1).\nThe indicator is drawn with a check mark inside.\nIf the checkbutton is not selected, then the indicator is drawn with a\ndeselected appearance, and the associated variable is\nset to a different value (typically 0).\nThe indicator is drawn without a check mark inside.  In the special case\nwhere the variable (if specified) has a value that matches the tristatevalue,\nthe indicator is drawn with a tri-state appearance and is in the tri-state\nmode indicating mixed or multiple values.  (This is used when the check\nbox represents the state of multiple items.)\nThe indicator is drawn in a platform dependent manner.  Under Unix and\nWindows, the background interior of the box is\ngrayed .\nUnder Mac, the indicator is drawn with a dash mark inside.\nBy default, the name of the variable associated with a checkbutton is the\nsame as the name used to create the checkbutton.\nThe variable name, and the\non ,\noff\nand\ntristate\nvalues stored in it, may be modified with options on the command line\nor in the option database.\nConfiguration options may also be used to modify the way the\nindicator is displayed (or whether it is displayed at all).\nBy default a checkbutton is configured to select and deselect\nitself on alternate button clicks.\nIn addition, each checkbutton monitors its associated variable and\nautomatically selects and deselects itself when the variables value\nchanges to and from the button's\non ,\noff\nand\ntristate\nvalues.\n\nUse Window.Checkbutton to create a Checkbutton with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk checkbutton page.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies a Tcl command to associate with the button.  This command\nis typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button\nwindow.  The button's global variable (-variable option) will\nbe updated before the command is invoked.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired height for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in lines of text.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nIndicatoron\n\nSpecifies whether or not the indicator should be drawn.  Must be a\nproper boolean value.  If false, the -relief option is\nignored and the widget's relief is always sunken if the widget is\nselected and raised otherwise.\n\nOffrelief\n\nSpecifies the relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not drawn and\nthe checkbutton is off.  The default value is\nBy setting this option to\nand setting -indicatoron to false and -overrelief to\nthe effect is achieved\nof having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and which is\ndepressed when activated.  This is the behavior typically exhibited by\nthe Bold, Italic, and Underline checkbuttons on the toolbar of a\nword-processor, for example.\n\nOffvalue\n\nSpecifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever\nthis button is deselected.  Defaults to\n\nOnvalue\n\nSpecifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever\nthis button is selected.  Defaults to\n\nOverrelief\n\nSpecifies an alternative relief for the checkbutton, to be used when the\nmouse cursor is over the widget.  This option can be used to make\ntoolbar buttons, by configuring -relief flat -overrelief\nraised.  If the value of this option is the empty string, then no\nalternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the checkbutton.\nThe empty string is the default value.\n\nSelectcolor\n\nSpecifies a background color to use when the button is selected.\nIf indicatorOn is true then the color is used as the background for\nthe indicator regardless of the select state.\nIf indicatorOn is false, this color is used as the background\nfor the entire widget, in place of background or activeBackground,\nwhenever the widget is selected.\nIf specified as an empty string then no special color is used for\ndisplaying when the widget is selected.\n\nSelectimage\n\nSpecifies an image to display (in place of the -image option)\nwhen the checkbutton is selected.\nThis option is ignored unless the -image option has been\nspecified.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the checkbutton:  normal, active,\nor disabled.  In normal state the checkbutton is displayed using the\n-foreground and -background options.  The active state is\ntypically used when the pointer is over the checkbutton.  In active state\nthe checkbutton is displayed using the -activeforeground and\n-activebackground options.  Disabled state means that the checkbutton\nshould be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate\nthe widget and will ignore mouse button presses.\nIn this state the -disabledforeground and\n-background options determine how the checkbutton is displayed.\n\nTristateimage\n\nSpecifies an image to display (in place of the -image option)\nwhen the checkbutton is in tri-state mode.\nThis option is ignored unless the -image option has been\nspecified.\n\nTristatevalue\n\nSpecifies the value that causes the checkbutton to display the multi-value\nselection, also known as the tri-state mode.  Defaults to\n\nVariable\n\nSpecifies the name of a global variable to set to indicate whether\nor not this button is selected.  Defaults to the name of the\nbutton within its parent (i.e. the last element of the button\nwindow's path name).\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired width for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in characters.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired width is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\ncheckbutton — Create and manipulate 'checkbutton' boolean selection widgets\n\nDeselects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its “off” value.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk checkbutton page.\n\ncheckbutton — Create and manipulate 'checkbutton' boolean selection widgets\n\nDoes just what would have happened if the user invoked the checkbutton with\nthe mouse: toggle the selection state of the button and invoke the Tcl\ncommand associated with the checkbutton, if there is one. The return value\nis the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no\ncommand associated with the checkbutton. This command is ignored if the\ncheckbutton's state is disabled.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk checkbutton page.\n\ncheckbutton — Create and manipulate 'checkbutton' boolean selection widgets\n\nSelects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its “on” value.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk checkbutton page.\n\nEntryWidget represents the Tcl/Tk entry widget/window\n\nEntry — Create and manipulate 'entry' one-line text entry widgets\n\nThe entry command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into an entry widget.\nAdditional options, described above, may be specified on the\ncommand line or in the option database\nto configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font,\nand relief.  The entry command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nAn entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and\nallows that string to be edited using widget commands described below, which\nare typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions.\nWhen first created, an entry's string is empty.\nA portion of the entry may be selected as described below.\nIf an entry is exporting its selection (see the -exportselection\noption), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the\nselection;  entry selections are available as type STRING.\nEntries also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with the\ninput focus.  When an entry has the input focus it displays an\ninsertion cursor to indicate where new characters will be\ninserted.\n\nEntries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to\nfit entirely within the widget's window.  In this case, only a\nportion of the string will be displayed;  commands described below\nmay be used to change the view in the window.  Entries use\nthe standard -xscrollcommand mechanism for interacting with\nscrollbars (see the description of the -xscrollcommand option\nfor details).  They also support scanning, as described below.\n\nUse Window.Entry to create a Entry with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk entry page.\n\nDisabledbackground\n\nSpecifies the background color to use when the entry is disabled.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal background color is used.\n\nDisabledforeground\n\nSpecifies the foreground color to use when the entry is disabled.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal foreground color is used.\n\nInvalidcommand\n\nSpecifies a script to eval when -validatecommand returns 0.\nSetting it to {} disables this feature (the default).  The best use\nof this option is to set it to bell.  See VALIDATION\nbelow for more information.\n\nReadonlybackground\n\nSpecifies the background color to use when the entry is readonly.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal background color is used.\n\nShow\n\nIf this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry\nare not displayed in the window.\nInstead, each character in the entry's value will be displayed as\nthe first character in the value of this option, such as\nThis is useful, for example, if the entry is to be used to enter\na password.\nIf characters in the entry are selected and copied elsewhere, the\ninformation copied will be what is displayed, not the true contents\nof the entry.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the entry:  normal,\ndisabled, or readonly.  If the entry is readonly, then the\nvalue may not be changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor\nwill be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget; the\ncontents of the widget may still be selected.  If the entry is\ndisabled, the value may not be changed, no insertion cursor will be\ndisplayed, the contents will not be selectable, and the entry may\nbe displayed in a different color, depending on the values of the\n-disabledforeground and -disabledbackground options.\n\nValidate\n\nSpecifies the mode in which validation should operate: none,\nfocus, focusin, focusout, key, or all.\nIt defaults to none.  When you want validation, you must explicitly\nstate which mode you wish to use.  See VALIDATION below for more.\n\nValidatecommand\n\nSpecifies a script to eval when you want to validate the input into\nthe entry widget.  Setting it to {} disables this feature (the default).\nThis command must return a valid Tcl boolean value.  If it returns 0 (or\nthe valid Tcl boolean equivalent) then it means you reject the new edition\nand it will not occur and the -invalidcommand will be evaluated if it\nis set. If it returns 1, then the new edition occurs.\nSee VALIDATION below for more information.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the entry window,\nin average-size characters of the widget's font.\nIf the value is negative or zero, the widget picks a\nsize just large enough to hold its current text.\n\nEvent communicates information with an event handler. All handlers can use the Err field. Simple\nhandlers, like in\n\ncan use the 'W' field, if applicable.  All other fields are valid only in\nhandlers bound using Bind.\n\nScrollSet communicates events to scrollbars. Example:\n\nSetReturnCodeBreak sets return code of 'e' to TCL_BREAK.\n\nSetReturnCodeContinue sets return code of 'e' to TCL_CONTINUE.\n\nSetReturnCodeError sets return code of 'e' to TCL_ERROR.\n\nSetReturnCodeOK sets return code of 'e' to TCL_OK.\n\nSetReturnCodeReturn sets return code of 'e' to TCL_RETURN.\n\nXview communicates events to views. Example:\n\nYview communicates events to views. Example:\n\nEventHandler is the type used by call backs.\n\nFileType specifies a single file type for the Filetypes option.\n\nFontFace represents a Tk font.\n\nNewFont — Create and inspect fonts.\n\nCreates a new font.\n\nThe following options are supported on all platforms, and are used when\ncreating/specifying a font:\n\nThe case-insensitive font family name. Tk guarantees to support the font\nfamilies named Courier (a monospaced “typewriter” font), Times (a serifed\n“newspaper” font), and Helvetica (a sans-serif “European” font). The most\nclosely matching native font family will automatically be substituted when\none of the above font families is used. The name may also be the name of a\nnative, platform-specific font family; in that case it will work as desired\non one platform but may not display correctly on other platforms. If the\nfamily is unspecified or unrecognized, a platform-specific default font will\nbe chosen.\n\nThe desired size of the font. If the size argument is a positive number, it\nis interpreted as a size in points. If size is a negative number, its\nabsolute value is interpreted as a size in pixels. If a font cannot be\ndisplayed at the specified size, a nearby size will be chosen. If size is\nunspecified or zero, a platform-dependent default size will be chosen.\n\nSizes should normally be specified in points so the application will remain\nthe same ruler size on the screen, even when changing screen resolutions or\nmoving scripts across platforms. However, specifying pixels is useful in\ncertain circumstances such as when a piece of text must line up with respect\nto a fixed-size bitmap. The mapping between points and pixels is set when\nthe application starts, based on properties of the installed monitor, but it\ncan be overridden by calling the tk scaling command.\n\nThe nominal thickness of the characters in the font. The value normal\nspecifies a normal weight font, while bold specifies a bold font. The\nclosest available weight to the one specified will be chosen. The default\nweight is normal.\n\nThe amount the characters in the font are slanted away from the vertical.\nValid values for slant are roman and italic. A roman font is the normal,\nupright appearance of a font, while an italic font is one that is tilted\nsome number of degrees from upright. The closest available slant to the one\nspecified will be chosen. The default slant is roman.\n\nThe value is a boolean flag that specifies whether characters in this font\nshould be underlined. The default value for underline is false.\n\nThe value is a boolean flag that specifies whether a horizontal line should\nbe drawn through the middle of characters in this font. The default value\nfor overstrike is false.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk font page.\n\nDelete — Manipulate fonts.\n\nDelete the font. If there are widgets using the named font, the named font\nwill not actually be deleted until all the instances are released. Those\nwidgets will continue to display using the last known values for the named\nfont. If a deleted named font is subsequently recreated with another call to\nfont create, the widgets will use the new named font and redisplay\nthemselves using the new attributes of that font.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk font page.\n\nString implements fmt.Stringer.\n\nFrameWidget represents the Tcl/Tk frame widget/window\n\nFrame — Create and manipulate 'frame' simple container widgets\n\nThe frame command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a frame widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the frame such as its background color\nand relief.  The frame command returns the\npath name of the new window.\n\nA frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a\nspacer or container for complex window layouts.  The only features\nof a frame are its background and an optional 3-D border to make the\nframe appear raised or sunken.\n\nUse Window.Frame to create a Frame with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk frame page.\n\nBackground\n\nThis option is the same as the standard -background option\nexcept that its value may also be specified as an empty string.\nIn this case, the widget will display no background or border, and\nno colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background\nand border.\nAn empty background will disable drawing the background image.\n\nBackgroundimage\n\nThis specifies an image to display on the frame's background within\nthe border of the frame (i.e., the image will be clipped by the\nframe's highlight ring and border, if either are present); subwidgets\nof the frame will be drawn on top. The image must have been created\nwith the image create command. If specified as the empty string,\nno image will be displayed.\n\nClass\n\nSpecifies a class for the window.\nThis class will be used when querying the option database for\nthe window's other options, and it will also be used later for\nother purposes such as bindings.\nThe -class option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nColormap\n\nSpecifies a colormap to use for the window.\nThe value may be either new, in which case a new colormap is\ncreated for the window and its children, or the name of another\nwindow (which must be on the same screen and have the same visual\nas pathName), in which case the new window will use the colormap\nfrom the specified window.\nIf the -colormap option is not specified, the new window\nuses the same colormap as its parent.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nContainer\n\nThe value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will\nbe used as a container in which some other application will be embedded\n(for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the -use option).\nThe window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for\nthings like geometry requests.  The window should not have any\nchildren of its own in this application.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\nNote that -borderwidth, -padx and -pady are ignored when\nconfigured as a container since a container has no border.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is negative or\nzero then the window will not request any size at all.  Note that this\nsets the total height of the frame, any -borderwidth or similar is\nnot added.  Normally -height should not be used if a propagating\ngeometry manager, such as grid or pack, is used within the\nframe since the geometry manager will override the height of the frame.\n\nTile\n\nThis specifies how to draw the background image (see\n-backgroundimage) on the frame.\nIf true (according to Tcl_GetBoolean), the image will be tiled\nto fill the whole frame, with the origin of the first copy of the\nimage being the top left of the interior of the frame.\nIf false (the default), the image will be centered within the frame.\n\nVisual\n\nSpecifies visual information for the new window in any of the\nforms accepted by Tk_GetVisual.\nIf this option is not specified, the new window will use the same\nvisual as its parent.\nThe -visual option may not be modified with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is negative or\nzero then the window will not request any size at all.  Note that this\nsets the total width of the frame, any -borderwidth or similar is\nnot added.  Normally -width should not be used if a propagating\ngeometry manager, such as grid or pack, is used within the\nframe since the geometry manager will override the width of the frame.\n\nImg represents a Tk image.\n\nBitmap — Images that display two colors\n\nA bitmap is an image whose pixels can display either of two colors or be\ntransparent. A bitmap image is defined by four things: a background color, a\nforeground color, and two bitmaps, called the source and the mask. Each of\nthe bitmaps specifies 0/1 values for a rectangular array of pixels, and the\ntwo bitmaps must have the same dimensions. For pixels where the mask is\nzero, the image displays nothing, producing a transparent effect. For other\npixels, the image displays the foreground color if the source data is one\nand the background color if the source data is zero.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk bitmap page.\n\nSpecifies a background color for the image in any of the standard ways\naccepted by Tk. If this option is set to an empty string then the background\npixels will be transparent. This effect is achieved by using the source\nbitmap as the mask bitmap, ignoring any -maskdata or -maskfile options.\n\nSpecifies the contents of the source bitmap as a string. The string must\nadhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program). If\nboth the -data and -file options are specified, the -data option takes\nprecedence.\n\nname gives the name of a file whose contents define the source bitmap. The\nfile must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap\nprogram).\n\nSpecifies a foreground color for the image in any of the standard ways\naccepted by Tk.\n\nSpecifies the contents of the mask as a string. The string must adhere to\nX11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program). If both the\n-maskdata and -maskfile options are specified, the -maskdata option takes\nprecedence.\n\nname gives the name of a file whose contents define the mask. The file must\nadhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap program).\n\nPhoto — Full-color images\n\nA photo is an image whose pixels can display any color with a varying degree\nof transparency (the alpha channel). A photo image is stored internally in\nfull color (32 bits per pixel), and is displayed using dithering if\nnecessary. Image data for a photo image can be obtained from a file or a\nstring, or it can be supplied from C code through a procedural interface. At\npresent, only PNG, GIF, PPM/PGM, and (read-only) SVG formats are supported,\nbut an interface exists to allow additional image file formats to be added\neasily. A photo image is (semi)transparent if the image data it was obtained\nfrom had transparency information. In regions where no image data has been\nsupplied, it is fully transparent. Transparency may also be modified with\nthe transparency set subcommand.\n\nSpecifies the contents of the image as a string. The string should contain\nbinary data or, for some formats, base64-encoded data (this is currently\nguaranteed to be supported for PNG and GIF images). The format of the string\nmust be one of those for which there is an image file format handler that\nwill accept string data. If both the -data and -file options are specified,\nthe -file option takes precedence.\n\nSpecifies the name of the file format for the data specified with the -data\nor -file option.\n\nname gives the name of a file that is to be read to supply data for the\nphoto image. The file format must be one of those for which there is an\nimage file format handler that can read data.\n\nSpecifies that the colors allocated for displaying this image in a window\nshould be corrected for a non-linear display with the specified gamma\nexponent value. (The intensity produced by most CRT displays is a power\nfunction of the input value, to a good approximation; gamma is the exponent\nand is typically around 2). The value specified must be greater than zero.\nThe default value is one (no correction). In general, values greater than\none will make the image lighter, and values less than one will make it\ndarker.\n\nSpecifies the height of the image, in pixels. This option is useful\nprimarily in situations where the user wishes to build up the contents of\nthe image piece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the image to\nexpand or shrink vertically to fit the data stored in it.\n\nSpecifies the resolution of the color cube to be allocated for displaying\nthis image, and thus the number of colors used from the colormaps of the\nwindows where it is displayed. The palette-spec string may be either a\nsingle decimal number, specifying the number of shades of gray to use, or\nthree decimal numbers separated by slashes (/), specifying the number of\nshades of red, green and blue to use, respectively. If the first form (a\nsingle number) is used, the image will be displayed in monochrome (i.e.,\ngrayscale).\n\nSpecifies the width of the image, in pixels. This option is useful primarily\nin situations where the user wishes to build up the contents of the image\npiece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the image to expand or\nshrink horizontally to fit the data stored in it.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk photo page.\n\nphoto — Full-color images\n\nCopies a region from the image called sourceImage (which must be a photo\nimage) to the image called imageName, possibly with pixel zooming and/or\nsubsampling. If no options are specified, this command copies the whole of\nsourceImage into imageName, starting at coordinates (0,0) in imageName.\n\nThe following options may be specified:\n\nSpecifies a rectangular sub-region of the source image to be copied. (x1,y1)\nand (x2,y2) specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. If x2 and\ny2 are not specified, the default value is the bottom-right corner of the\nsource image. The pixels copied will include the left and top edges of the\nspecified rectangle but not the bottom or right edges. If the -from option\nis not given, the default is the whole source image.\n\nSpecifies a rectangular sub-region of the destination image to be affected.\n(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. If\nx2 and y2 are not specified, the default value is (x1,y1) plus the size of\nthe source region (after subsampling and zooming, if specified). If x2 and\ny2 are specified, the source region will be replicated if necessary to fill\nthe destination region in a tiled fashion.\n\nThe function returns 'm'.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk photo page.\n\nimage — Create and manipulate images\n\nDeletes 'm!. If there are\ninstances of the image displayed in widgets, the image will not actually\nbe deleted until all of the instances are released. However, the association\nbetween the instances and the image manager will be dropped. Existing\ninstances will retain their sizes but redisplay as empty areas. If a deleted\nimage is recreated with another call to image create, the existing instances\nwill use the new image.\n\nGraph — use gnuplot to draw on a photo. Graph returns 'm'\n\nThe 'script' argument is passed to a gnuplot executable, which must be\ninstalled on the machine.  See the gnuplot site for documentation about\nproducing graphs. The script must not use the 'set term \u003cdevice\u003e' command.\n\nThe content of 'm' is replaced, including its internal name.\n\nHeight — Get the configured option value.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk photo page.\n\nString implements fmt.Stringer.\n\nWidth — Get the configured option value.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk photo page.\n\nLC encodes a text index consisting of a line and char number.\n\nString implements fmt.Stringer.\n\nLabelWidget represents the Tcl/Tk label widget/window\n\nLabel — Create and manipulate 'label' non-interactive text or image widgets\n\nThe label command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a label widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the label such as its colors, font,\ntext, and initial relief.  The label command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA label is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.\nIf text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it\ncan occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines\nor if wrapping occurs because of the -wraplength option) and\none of the characters may optionally be underlined using the\nThe label can be manipulated in a few simple ways, such as\nchanging its relief or text, using the commands described below.\n\nUse Window.Label to create a Label with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk label page.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired height for the label.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in lines of text.\nIf this option is not specified, the label's desired height is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the label:  normal, active,\nor disabled.  In normal state the button is displayed using the\n-foreground and -background options.  In active state\nthe label is displayed using the -activeforeground and\n-activebackground options.  In the disabled state the\n-disabledforeground and -background options determine how\nthe button is displayed.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired width for the label.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in characters.\nIf this option is not specified, the label's desired width is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nLabelframeWidget represents the Tcl/Tk labelframe widget/window\n\nLabelframe — Create and manipulate 'labelframe' labelled container widgets\n\nThe labelframe command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a labelframe widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the labelframe such as its background color\nand relief.  The labelframe command returns the\npath name of the new window.\n\nA labelframe is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a\nspacer or container for complex window layouts.  It has the features\nof a frame plus the ability to display a label.\n\nUse Window.Labelframe to create a Labelframe with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk labelframe page.\n\nBackground\n\nThis option is the same as the standard -background option\nexcept that its value may also be specified as an empty string.\nIn this case, the widget will display no background or border, and\nno colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background\nand border.\n\nClass\n\nSpecifies a class for the window.\nThis class will be used when querying the option database for\nthe window's other options, and it will also be used later for\nother purposes such as bindings.\nThe -class option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nColormap\n\nSpecifies a colormap to use for the window.\nThe value may be either new, in which case a new colormap is\ncreated for the window and its children, or the name of another\nwindow (which must be on the same screen and have the same visual\nas pathName), in which case the new window will use the colormap\nfrom the specified window.\nIf the -colormap option is not specified, the new window\nuses the same colormap as its parent.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this option is negative or zero then the window will\nnot request any size at all.\n\nLabelanchor\n\nSpecifies where to place the label. A label is only displayed if the\n-text option is not the empty string.\nValid values for this option are (listing them clockwise)\nnw, n, ne, en, e, es,\nse, s,sw, ws, w and wn.\nThe default value is nw.\n\nLabelwidget\n\nSpecifies a widget to use as label. This overrides any -text\noption. The widget must exist before being used as -labelwidget\nand if it is not a descendant of this window, it will be raised\nabove it in the stacking order.\n\nVisual\n\nSpecifies visual information for the new window in any of the\nforms accepted by Tk_GetVisual.\nIf this option is not specified, the new window will use the same\nvisual as its parent.\nThe -visual option may not be modified with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this option is negative or zero then the window will\nnot request any size at all.\n\nListboxWidget represents the Tcl/Tk listbox widget/window\n\nListbox — Create and manipulate 'listbox' item list widgets\n\nThe listbox command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a listbox widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the listbox such as its colors, font,\ntext, and relief.  The listbox command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.\nWhen first created, a new listbox has no elements.\nElements may be added or deleted using widget commands described\nbelow.  In addition, one or more elements may be selected as described\nbelow.\nIf a listbox is exporting its selection (see -exportselection\noption), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols\nfor handling the selection.\nListbox selections are available as type STRING;\nthe value of the selection will be the text of the selected elements, with\nnewlines separating the elements.\n\nIt is not necessary for all the elements to be\ndisplayed in the listbox window at once;  commands described below\nmay be used to change the view in the window.  Listboxes allow\nscrolling in both directions using the standard -xscrollcommand\nand -yscrollcommand options.\nThey also support scanning, as described below.\n\nUse Window.Listbox to create a Listbox with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk listbox page.\n\nActivestyle\n\nSpecifies the style in which to draw the active element.  This must be\none of dotbox (show a focus ring around the active element),\nnone (no special indication of active element) or\nunderline (underline the active element).\nThe default is underline on Windows, and dotbox elsewhere.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies the desired height for the window, in lines.\nIf zero or less, then the desired height for the window is made just\nlarge enough to hold all the elements in the listbox.\n\nListvariable\n\nSpecifies the name of a global variable.  The value of the variable is a list to\nbe displayed inside the widget; if the variable value changes then the\nwidget will automatically update itself to reflect the new value.  Attempts\nto assign a variable with an invalid list value to -listvariable\nwill cause an error.  Attempts to unset a variable in use as a\n-listvariable will fail but will not generate an error.\n\nSelectmode\n\nSpecifies one of several styles for manipulating the selection.\nThe value of the option may be arbitrary, but the default bindings\nexpect it to be either single, browse, multiple,\nor extended;  the default value is browse.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of two states for the listbox:  normal or disabled.\nIf the listbox is disabled then items may not be inserted or deleted,\nitems are drawn in the -disabledforeground color, and selection\ncannot be modified and is not shown (though selection information is retained).\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired width for the window in characters.\nIf the font does not have a uniform width then the width of the character\nis used in translating from character units to screen units.\nIf zero or less, then the desired width for the window is made just\nlarge enough to hold all the elements in the listbox.\n\nMenuItem represents an entry on a menu.\n\nString implements fmt.Stringer.\n\nMenuWidget represents the Tcl/Tk menu widget/window\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nUse Window.Menu to create a Menu with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nPostcommand\n\nIf this option is specified then it provides a Tcl command to execute\neach time the menu is posted.  The command is invoked by the post\nwidget command before posting the menu. Note that in Tk 8.0 on Macintosh\nand Windows, all post-commands in a system of menus are executed before any\nof those menus are posted.\nThis is due to the limitations in the individual platforms' menu managers.\n\nSelectcolor\n\nFor menu entries that are check buttons or radio buttons, this option\nspecifies the color to display in the indicator when the check button\nor radio button is selected.\n\nTearoff\n\nThis option must have a proper boolean value (default is false),\nwhich specifies whether or not the menu should include a tear-off\nentry at the top.  If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the menu and\nthe other entries will number starting at 1.  The default menu\nbindings arrange for the menu to be torn off when the tear-off entry\nis invoked.\nThis option is ignored under Aqua/macOS, where menus cannot\nbe torn off.\n\nTearoffcommand\n\nIf this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies a Tcl command\nto invoke whenever the menu is torn off.  The actual command will\nconsist of the value of this option, followed by a space, followed\nby the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by\nthe name of the name of the torn off menu window.  For example, if\nthe option's value is\nand menu .x.y is torn off to\ncreate a new menu .x.tearoff1, then the command\nwill be invoked.\nThis option is ignored under Aqua/macOS, where menus cannot\nbe torn off.\n\nTitle\n\nThe string will be used to title the window created when this menu is\ntorn off. If the title is NULL, then the window will have the title\nof the menubutton or the text of the cascade item from which this menu\nwas invoked.\n\nType\n\nThis option can be one of menubar, tearoff, or\nnormal, and is set when the menu is created. While the string\nreturned by the configuration database will change if this option is\nchanged, this does not affect the menu widget's behavior. This is used\nby the cloning mechanism and is not normally set outside of the Tk\nlibrary.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nAdd a new cascade entry to the end of the menu.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nAdd a new checkbutton entry to the bottom of the menu.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nAdd a new command entry to the bottom of the menu.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nAdd a new radiobutton entry to the bottom of the menu.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nAdd a new separator entry to the bottom of the menu.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nThis command is similar to the configure command, except that it applies to\nthe options for an individual entry, whereas configure applies to the\noptions for the menu as a whole. Options may have any of the values\ndescribed in the MENU ENTRY OPTIONS section below. If options are specified,\noptions are modified as indicated in the command and the command returns an\nempty string. If no options are specified, returns a list describing the\ncurrent options for entry index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the\nformat of this list).\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenu — Create and manipulate 'menu' widgets and menubars\n\nInvoke the action of the menu entry. See the sections on the individual\nentries above for details on what happens. If the menu entry is disabled\nthen nothing happens. If the entry has a command associated with it then the\nresult of that command is returned as the result of the invoke widget\ncommand. Otherwise the result is an empty string. Note: invoking a menu\nentry does not automatically unpost the menu; the default bindings normally\ntake care of this before invoking the invoke widget command.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menu page.\n\nMenubuttonWidget represents the Tcl/Tk menubutton widget/window\n\nMenubutton — Create and manipulate 'menubutton' pop-up menu indicator widgets\n\nUse Window.Menubutton to create a Menubutton with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk menubutton page.\n\nDirection\n\nSpecifies where the menu is going to be popup up. above tries to\npop the menu above the menubutton. below tries to pop the menu\nbelow the menubutton. left tries to pop the menu to the left of\nthe menubutton. right tries to pop the menu to the right of the\nmenu button. flush pops the menu directly over the menubutton.\nIn the case of above or below, the direction will be\nreversed if the menu would show offscreen.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired height for the menubutton.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the menubutton then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in lines of text.\nIf this option is not specified, the menubutton's desired height is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nIndicatoron\n\nThe value must be a proper boolean value.  If it is true then\na small indicator rectangle will be displayed on the right side\nof the menubutton and the default menu bindings will treat this\nas an option menubutton.  If false then no indicator will be\ndisplayed.\n\nMnu\n\nSpecifies the path name of the menu associated with this menubutton.\nThe menu must be a child of the menubutton.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the menubutton:  normal, active,\nor disabled.  In normal state the menubutton is displayed using the\nforeground and background options.  The active state is\ntypically used when the pointer is over the menubutton.  In active state\nthe menubutton is displayed using the -activeforeground and\n-activebackground options.  Disabled state means that the menubutton\nshould be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate\nthe widget and will ignore mouse button presses.\nIn this state the -disabledforeground and\n-background options determine how the button is displayed.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired width for the menubutton.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the menubutton then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in characters.\nIf this option is not specified, the menubutton's desired width is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nMessageWidget represents the Tcl/Tk message widget/window\n\nMessage — Create and manipulate 'message' non-interactive text widgets\n\nThe message command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a message widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font,\ntext, and initial relief.  The message command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA message is a widget that displays a textual string.  A message\nwidget has three special features that differentiate it from a\nlabel widget.  First, it breaks up\nits string into lines in order to produce a given aspect ratio\nfor the window.  The line breaks are chosen at word boundaries\nwherever possible (if not even a single word would fit on a\nline, then the word will be split across lines).  Newline characters\nin the string will force line breaks;  they can be used, for example,\nto leave blank lines in the display.\n\nThe second feature of a message widget is justification.  The text\nmay be displayed left-justified (each line starts at the left side of\nthe window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified\n(each line ends at the right side of the window).\n\nThe third feature of a message widget is that it handles control\ncharacters and non-printing characters specially.  Tab characters\nare replaced with enough blank space to line up on the next\n8-character boundary.  Newlines cause line breaks.  Other control\ncharacters (ASCII code less than 0x20) and characters not defined\nin the font are displayed as a four-character sequence \\exhh where\nhh is the two-digit hexadecimal number corresponding to\nthe character.  In the unusual case where the font does not contain\nall of the characters in\n0123456789abcdef\\ex\nthen control characters and undefined characters are not displayed at all.\n\nUse Window.Message to create a Message with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk message page.\n\nAspect\n\nSpecifies a non-negative integer value indicating desired\naspect ratio for the text.  The aspect ratio is specified as\n100*width/height.  100 means the text should\nbe as wide as it is tall, 200 means the text should\nbe twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should\nbe twice as tall as it is wide, and so on.\nUsed to choose line length for text if -width option\nis not specified.\nDefaults to 150.\n\nJustify\n\nSpecifies how to justify lines of text.\nMust be one of left, center, or right.  Defaults\nto left.\nThis option works together with the -anchor, -aspect,\n-padx, -pady, and -width options to provide a variety\nof arrangements of the text within the window.\nThe -aspect and -width options determine the amount of\nscreen space needed to display the text.\nThe -anchor, -padx, and -pady options determine where this\nrectangular area is displayed within the widget's window, and the\n-justify option determines how each line is displayed within that\nrectangular region.\nFor example, suppose -anchor is e and -justify is\nleft, and that the message window is much larger than needed\nfor the text.\nThe text will be displayed so that the left edges of all the lines\nline up and the right edge of the longest line is -padx from\nthe right side of the window;  the entire text block will be centered\nin the vertical span of the window.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the length of lines in the window.\nThe value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this option has a value greater than zero then the -aspect\noption is ignored and the -width option determines the line\nlength.\nIf this option value is negative or zero, then\nthe -aspect option determines the line length.\n\nOpt represents an optional argument.\n\nAccelerator option.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nActivebackground option.\n\nSpecifies background color to use when drawing active elements.\nAn element (a widget or portion of a widget) is active if the\nmouse cursor is positioned over the element and pressing a mouse button\nwill cause some action to occur.\nIf strict Motif compliance has been requested by setting the\ntk_strictMotif variable, this option will normally be\nignored;  the normal background color will be used instead.\nFor some elements on Windows and Macintosh systems, the active color\nwill only be used while mouse button 1 is pressed over the element.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nActiveborderwidth option.\n\nSpecifies a non-negative value indicating\nthe width of the 3-D border drawn around active elements.  See above for\ndefinition of active elements.\nThe value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nThis option is typically only available in widgets displaying more\nthan one element at a time (e.g. menus but not buttons).\n\nKnown uses:\n\nActiveforeground option.\n\nSpecifies foreground color to use when drawing active elements.\nSee above for definition of active elements.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nActiverelief option.\n\nSpecifies the 3-D effect desired for the active item of the widget.\nSee the -relief option for details.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nActivestyle option.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nAfter option.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nAlign option.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nAnchor option.\n\nSpecifies how the information in a widget (e.g. text or a bitmap)\nis to be displayed in the widget.\nMust be one of the values n, ne, e, se,\ns, sw, w, nw, or center.\nFor example, nw means display the information such that its\ntop-left corner is at the top-left corner of the widget.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nArrowcolor — Styling widgets\n\nArrowcolor is a styling option of one or more widgets.

If an empty string, the widget will be\nmade wide enough to allow all contained widgets to have their natural width.\n\npanedwindow — Create and manipulate 'panedwindow' split container widgets\n\nAdd one or more windows to the panedwindow, each in a separate pane. The\narguments consist of the names of one or more windows followed by pairs of\narguments that specify how to manage the windows. Option may have any of the\nvalues accepted by the configure subcommand.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk panedwindow page.\n\npanedwindow — Create and manipulate 'panedwindow' split container widgets\n\nQuery a management option for window. Option may be any value allowed by the\npaneconfigure subcommand.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk panedwindow page.\n\npanedwindow — Create and manipulate 'panedwindow' split container widgets\n\nQuery or modify the management options for window. If no option is\nspecified, returns a list describing all of the available options for\npathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this list).\nIf option is specified with no value, then the command returns a list\ndescribing the one named option (this list will be identical to the\ncorresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is specified). If\none or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies the\ngiven widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command\nreturns an empty string.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk panedwindow page.\n\nRadiobuttonWidget represents the Tcl/Tk radiobutton widget/window\n\nRadiobutton — Create and manipulate 'radiobutton' pick-one widgets\n\nThe radiobutton command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a radiobutton widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the radiobutton such as its colors, font,\ntext, and initial relief.  The radiobutton command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA radiobutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image\nand a diamond or circle called an indicator.\nIf text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it\ncan occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines\nor if wrapping occurs because of the -wraplength option) and\none of the characters may optionally be underlined using the\nall of the behavior of a simple button: it can display itself in either\nof three different ways, according to the -state option;\nit can be made to appear\nraised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes\na Tcl command whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the\ncheck button.\n\nIn addition, radiobuttons can be selected.\nIf a radiobutton is selected, the indicator is normally\ndrawn with a selected appearance, and\na Tcl variable associated with the radiobutton is set to a particular\nvalue (normally 1).\nUnder Unix, the indicator is drawn with a sunken relief and a special\ncolor.  Under Windows, the indicator is drawn with a round mark inside.\nIf the radiobutton is not selected, then the indicator is drawn with a\ndeselected appearance, and the associated variable is\nset to a different value (typically 0).\nThe indicator is drawn without a round mark inside.\nTypically, several radiobuttons share a single variable and the\nvalue of the variable indicates which radiobutton is to be selected.\nWhen a radiobutton is selected it sets the value of the variable to\nindicate that fact;  each radiobutton also monitors the value of\nthe variable and automatically selects and deselects itself when the\nvariable's value changes.\nIf the variable's value matches the -tristatevalue, then the radiobutton\nis drawn using the tri-state mode.  This mode is used to indicate mixed or\nmultiple values.  (This is used when the radiobutton represents the state\nof multiple items.)\nBy default the variable selectedButton\nis used;  its contents give the name of the button that is\nselected, or the empty string if no button associated with that\nvariable is selected.\nThe name of the variable for a radiobutton,\nplus the variable to be stored into it, may be modified with options\non the command line or in the option database.\nConfiguration options may also be used to modify the way the\nindicator is displayed (or whether it is displayed at all).\nBy default a radiobutton is configured to select itself on button clicks.\n\nUse Window.Radiobutton to create a Radiobutton with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk radiobutton page.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies a Tcl command to associate with the button.  This command\nis typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button\nwindow.  The button's global variable (-variable option) will\nbe updated before the command is invoked.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies a desired height for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in lines of text.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nIndicatoron\n\nSpecifies whether or not the indicator should be drawn.  Must be a\nproper boolean value.  If false, the -relief option is\nignored and the widget's relief is always sunken if the widget is\nselected and raised otherwise.\n\nOffrelief\n\nSpecifies the relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not drawn and\nthe checkbutton is off.  The default value is\nBy setting this option to\nand setting -indicatoron to false and -overrelief to\nthe effect is achieved\nof having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and which is\ndepressed when activated.  This is the behavior typically exhibited by\nthe Align-Left, Align-Right, and Center radiobuttons on the toolbar of a\nword-processor, for example.\n\nOverrelief\n\nSpecifies an alternative relief for the radiobutton, to be used when the\nmouse cursor is over the widget.  This option can be used to make\ntoolbar buttons, by configuring -relief flat -overrelief\nraised.  If the value of this option is the empty string, then no\nalternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the radiobutton.\nThe empty string is the default value.\n\nSelectcolor\n\nSpecifies a background color to use when the button is selected.\nIf indicatorOn is true then the color is used as the background for\nthe indicator regardless of the select state.\nIf -indicatoron is false, this color is used as the background for the\nentire widget, in place of -background or -activeBackground,\nwhenever the widget is selected.\nIf specified as an empty string then no special color is used for\ndisplaying when the widget is selected.\n\nSelectimage\n\nSpecifies an image to display (in place of the -image option)\nwhen the radiobutton is selected.\nThis option is ignored unless the -image option has been\nspecified.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the radiobutton:  normal, active,\nor disabled.  In normal state the radiobutton is displayed using the\n-foreground and -background options.  The active state is\ntypically used when the pointer is over the radiobutton.  In active state\nthe radiobutton is displayed using the -activeforeground and\n-activebackground options.  Disabled state means that the radiobutton\nshould be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate\nthe widget and will ignore mouse button presses.\nIn this state the -disabledforeground and\n-background options determine how the radiobutton is displayed.\n\nTristateimage\n\nSpecifies an image to display (in place of the -image option)\nwhen the radiobutton is selected.\nThis option is ignored unless the -image option has been\nspecified.\n\nTristatevalue\n\nSpecifies the value that causes the radiobutton to display the multi-value\nselection, also known as the tri-state mode.  Defaults to\n\nValue\n\nSpecifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever\nthis button is selected.\n\nVariable\n\nSpecifies the name of a global variable to set whenever this button is\nselected.  Changes in this variable also cause the button to select\nor deselect itself.\nDefaults to the value selectedButton.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies a desired width for the button.\nIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button, the value is in\nscreen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels);\nfor text it is in characters.\nIf this option is not specified, the button's desired width is computed\nfrom the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n\nScaleWidget represents the Tcl/Tk scale widget/window\n\nScale — Create and manipulate 'scale' value-controlled slider widgets\n\nThe scale command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a scale widget.\nAdditional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the scale such as its colors, orientation,\nand relief.  The scale command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA scale is a widget that displays a rectangular trough and a\nsmall slider.  The trough corresponds to a range\nof real values (determined by the -from, -to, and\nand the position of the slider selects a particular real value.\nThe slider's position (and hence the scale's value) may be adjusted\nwith the mouse or keyboard as described in the BINDINGS\nsection below.  Whenever the scale's value is changed, a Tcl\ncommand is invoked (using the -command option) to notify\nother interested widgets of the change.\nIn addition, the value\nof the scale can be linked to a Tcl variable (using the -variable\noption), so that changes in either are reflected in the other.\n\nThree annotations may be displayed in a scale widget:  a label\nappearing at the top right of the widget (top left for horizontal\nscales), a number displayed just to the left of the slider\n(just above the slider for horizontal scales), and a collection\nof numerical tick marks just to the left of the current value\n(just below the trough for horizontal scales).  Each of these three\nannotations may be enabled or disabled using the\nconfiguration options.\n\nUse Window.Scale to create a Scale with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk scale page.\n\nBigincrement\n\nSome interactions with the scale cause its value to change by\nincrements;  this option specifies the size of the\nlarge increments.  If specified as 0, the large increments default\nto 1/10 the range of the scale.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke whenever the scale's\nvalue is changed via a widget command.\nThe actual command consists\nof this option followed by a space and a real number indicating the\nnew value of the scale.\n\nDigits\n\nAn integer specifying how many significant digits should be retained\nwhen converting the value of the scale to a string.\nIf the number is negative or zero, then the scale picks\nthe smallest value that guarantees that every possible slider\nposition prints as a different string.\n\nFrom\n\nA real value corresponding to the left or top end of the scale.\n\nLbl\n\nA string to display as a label for the scale.  For\nvertical scales the label is displayed just to the right of the\ntop end of the scale.  For horizontal scales the label is displayed\njust above the left end of the scale.  If the option is specified\nas an empty string, no label is displayed.\n\nLength\n\nSpecifies the desired long dimension of the scale in screen units\n(i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels).\nFor vertical scales this is the scale's height;  for horizontal scales\nit is the scale's width.\n\nResolution\n\nA real value specifying the resolution for the scale.\nIf this value is greater than zero then the scale's value will always be\nrounded to an even multiple of this value, as will\nthe endpoints of the scale.  If the value is negative then no\nrounding occurs.  Defaults to 1 (i.e., the value will be integral).\n\nShowvalue\n\nSpecifies a boolean value indicating whether or not the current\nvalue of the scale is to be displayed.\n\nSliderlength\n\nSpecifies the size of the slider, measured in screen units along the slider's\nlong dimension.  The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable\nto Tk_GetPixels.\n\nSliderrelief\n\nSpecifies the relief to use when drawing the slider, such as raised\nor sunken.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the scale:  normal,\nactive, or disabled.\nIf the scale is disabled then the value may not be changed and the scale\nwill not activate.\nIf the scale is active, the slider is displayed using the color\nspecified by the -activebackground option.\n\nTickinterval\n\nMust be a real value.\nDetermines the spacing between numerical\ntick marks displayed below or to the left of the slider. The values will all\nbe displayed with the same number of decimal places, which will be enough to\nensure they are all accurate to within 20% of a tick interval.\nIf 0, no tick marks will be displayed.\n\nTo\n\nSpecifies a real value corresponding\nto the right or bottom end of the scale.\nThis value may be either less than or greater than the -from option.\n\nVariable\n\nSpecifies the name of a global variable to link to the scale.  Whenever the\nvalue of the variable changes, the scale will update to reflect this\nvalue.\nWhenever the scale is manipulated interactively, the variable\nwill be modified to reflect the scale's new value.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired narrow dimension of the scale in screen units\n(i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels).\nFor vertical scales this is the scale's width;  for horizontal scales\nthis is the scale's height.\n\nScrollbarWidget represents the Tcl/Tk scrollbar widget/window\n\nScrollbar — Create and manipulate 'scrollbar' scrolling control and indicator widgets\n\nThe scrollbar command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a scrollbar widget.\nAdditional options, described above, may be specified on the command\nline or in the option database to configure aspects of the scrollbar\nsuch as its colors, orientation, and relief.\nThe scrollbar command returns its pathName argument.\nAt the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window\nnamed pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\nA scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of\nthe scrollbar, and a slider in the middle portion of the\nscrollbar.\nIt provides information about what is visible in an associated window\nthat displays a document of some sort (such as a file being edited or\na drawing).\nThe position and size of the slider indicate which portion of the\ndocument is visible in the associated window.  For example, if the\nslider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area\nbetween the two arrows, it means that the associated window displays\nthe top third of its document.\n\nScrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window\nby clicking or dragging with the mouse.  See the BINDINGS section\nbelow for details.\n\nUse Window.Scrollbar to create a Scrollbar with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk scrollbar page.\n\nActiverelief\n\nSpecifies the relief to use when displaying the element that is\nactive, if any.\nElements other than the active element are always displayed with\na raised relief.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view\nin the widget associated with the scrollbar.  When a user requests\na view change by manipulating the scrollbar, a Tcl command is\ninvoked.  The actual command consists of this option followed by\nadditional information as described later.  This option almost always has\na value such as .t xview or .t yview, consisting of the\nname of a widget and either xview (if the scrollbar is for\nhorizontal scrolling) or yview (for vertical scrolling).\nAll scrollable widgets have xview and yview commands\nthat take exactly the additional arguments appended by the scrollbar\nas described in SCROLLING COMMANDS below.\n\nElementborderwidth\n\nSpecifies the width of borders drawn around the internal elements\nof the scrollbar (the two arrows and the slider).  The value may\nhave any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this value is the empty string (the default), the value of\nthe -borderwidth option is used in its place.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window,\nnot including 3-D border, if any.  For vertical\nscrollbars this will be the width and for horizontal scrollbars\nthis will be the height.\nThe value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\n\nSpinboxWidget represents the Tcl/Tk spinbox widget/window\n\nSpinbox — Create and manipulate 'spinbox' value spinner widgets\n\nThe spinbox command creates a new window (given by the\npathName argument) and makes it into a spinbox widget.\nAdditional options, described above, may be specified on the\ncommand line or in the option database\nto configure aspects of the spinbox such as its colors, font,\nand relief.  The spinbox command returns its\npathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked,\nthere must not exist a window named pathName, but\npathName's parent must exist.\n\nA spinbox is an extended entry widget that allows he user\nto move, or spin, through a fixed set of ascending or descending values\nsuch as times or dates in addition to editing the value as in an\nentry.  When first created, a spinbox's string is empty.\nA portion of the spinbox may be selected as described below.\nIf a spinbox is exporting its selection (see the -exportselection\noption), then it will observe the standard protocols for handling the\nselection;  spinbox selections are available as type STRING.\nSpinboxes also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with the\ninput focus.  When a spinbox has the input focus it displays an\ninsertion cursor to indicate where new characters will be\ninserted.\n\nSpinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too long to\nfit entirely within the widget's window.  In this case, only a\nportion of the string will be displayed; commands described below\nmay be used to change the view in the window.  Spinboxes use\nthe standard -xscrollcommand mechanism for interacting with\nscrollbars (see the description of the -xscrollcommand option\nfor details).  They also support scanning, as described below.\n\nUse Window.Spinbox to create a Spinbox with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk spinbox page.\n\nButtonbackground\n\nThe background color to be used for the spin buttons.\n\nButtoncursor\n\nThe cursor to be used when over the spin buttons.  If this is empty\n(the default), a default cursor will be used.\n\nButtondownrelief\n\nThe relief to be used for the upper spin button.\n\nButtonuprelief\n\nThe relief to be used for the lower spin button.\n\nCommand\n\nSpecifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever a spinbutton is invoked.\nThe command recognizes several percent substitutions: %W for\nthe widget path, %s for the current value of the widget, and\n%d for the direction of the button pressed (up or down).\n\nDisabledbackground\n\nSpecifies the background color to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal background color is used.\n\nDisabledforeground\n\nSpecifies the foreground color to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal foreground color is used.\n\nFormat\n\nSpecifies an alternate format to use when setting the string value\nwhen using the -from and -to range.\nThis must be a format specifier of the form %\u003cpad\u003e.\u003cpad\u003ef,\nas it will format a floating-point number.\n\nFrom\n\nA floating-point value corresponding to the lowest value for a spinbox, to\nbe used in conjunction with -to and -increment.  When all\nare specified correctly, the spinbox will use these values to control its\ncontents. If this value is greater than the -to option, then\n-from and -to values are automatically swapped.\nIf -values is specified, it supersedes this option.\n\nInvalidcommand\n\nSpecifies a script to eval when -validatecommand returns 0.  Setting\nit to an empty string disables this feature (the default).  The best use of\nthis option is to set it to bell.  See VALIDATION below for\nmore information.\n\nIncrement\n\nA floating-point value specifying the increment.  When used with\n-from and -to, the value in the widget will be adjusted by\n-increment when a spin button is pressed (up adds the value,\ndown subtracts the value).\n\nReadonlybackground\n\nSpecifies the background color to use when the spinbox is readonly.  If\nthis option is the empty string, the normal background color is used.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of three states for the spinbox:  normal,\ndisabled, or readonly.  If the spinbox is readonly, then the\nvalue may not be changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor\nwill be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget; the\ncontents of the widget may still be selected.  If the spinbox is\ndisabled, the value may not be changed, no insertion cursor will be\ndisplayed, the contents will not be selectable, and the spinbox may\nbe displayed in a different color, depending on the values of the\n-disabledforeground and -disabledbackground options.\n\nTo\n\nA floating-point value corresponding to the highest value for the spinbox,\nto be used in conjunction with -from and -increment.  When\nall are specified correctly, the spinbox will use these values to control\nits contents. If this value is less than the -from option, then\n-from and -to values are automatically swapped.\nIf -values is specified, it supersedes this option.\n\nValidate\n\nSpecifies the mode in which validation should operate: none,\nfocus, focusin, focusout, key, or all.\nIt defaults to none.  When you want validation, you must explicitly\nstate which mode you wish to use.  See VALIDATION below for more.\n\nValidatecommand\n\nSpecifies a script to evaluate when you want to validate the input in the\nwidget.  Setting it to an empty string disables this feature (the default).\nValidation occurs according to the value of -validate.\nThis command must return a valid Tcl boolean value.  If it returns 0 (or\nthe valid Tcl boolean equivalent) then the value of the widget will not\nchange and the -invalidcommand will be evaluated if it is set.  If it\nreturns 1, then value will be changed.\nSee VALIDATION below for more information.\n\nValues\n\nMust be a proper list value.  If specified, the spinbox will use these\nvalues as to control its contents, starting with the first value.  This\noption has precedence over the -from and -to range.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the spinbox window,\nin average-size characters of the widget's font.\nIf the value is negative or zero, the widget picks a\nsize just large enough to hold its current text.\n\nWrap\n\nMust be a proper boolean value.  If on, the spinbox will wrap around the\nvalues of data in the widget.\n\nTButtonWidget represents the Tcl/Tk ttk_button widget/window\n\nTButton — Widget that issues a command when pressed\n\nA ttk::button widget displays a textual label and/or image,\nand evaluates a command when pressed.\n\nUse Window.TButton to create a TButton with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk ttk_button page.\n\nCommand\n\nA script to evaluate when the widget is invoked.\n\nDefault\n\nMay be set to one of  normal, active, or disabled.\nIn a dialog box, one button may be designated the\nbutton (meaning, roughly,\nactive indicates that this is currently the default button;\nnormal means that it may become the default button, and\ndisabled means that it is not defaultable.\nThe default is normal.\n\nTtk::button widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard\nthemes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.\n\nIn the Aqua theme there are several other styles which can be used to\nproduce replicas of many of the different button types that are\ndiscussed in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

Valid options\nare:\n\nUse pathname heading \"#0\" to configure the tree column heading.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk treeview page.\n\nttk::treeview — hierarchical multicolumn data display widget\n\nCreates a new item. parent is the item ID of the parent item, or the empty\nstring {} to create a new top-level item. index is an integer, or the value\nend, specifying where in the list of parent's children to insert the new\nitem. If index is negative or zero, the new node is inserted at the\nbeginning; if index is greater than or equal to the current number of\nchildren, it is inserted at the end. If -id is specified, it is used as the\nitem identifier; id must not already exist in the tree. Otherwise, a new\nunique identifier is generated.\n\nInsert returns the item identifier of the newly created item. See\nITEM OPTIONS for the list of available options.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk treeview page.\n\nttk::treeview — hierarchical multicolumn data display widget\n\nQuery or modify the options for the specified item. If no -option is\nspecified, returns a dictionary of option/value pairs. If a single -option\nis specified, returns the value of that option. Otherwise, the item's\noptions are updated with the specified values. See ITEM OPTIONS for the list\nof available options.  pathname move item parent index\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk treeview page.\n\nttk::treeview — hierarchical multicolumn data display widget\n\nEnsure that item is visible: sets all of item's ancestors to -open true, and\nscrolls the widget if necessary so that item is within the visible portion\nof the tree.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk treeview page.\n\nttk::treeview — hierarchical multicolumn data display widget\n\nManages item selection. Item selection is independent from cell selection\nhandled by the cellselection command. If selop is not specified, returns the\nlist of selected items. Otherwise, selop is one of the following:\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk treeview page.\n\nTextWidget represents the Tcl/Tk text widget/window\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nThe text command creates a new window (given by the pathName\nargument) and makes it into a text widget. Additional options, described\nabove, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to\nconfigure aspects of the text such as its default background color and relief.\nThe text command returns the path name of the new window.\n\nA text widget displays one or more lines of text and allows that text to be\nedited. Text widgets support four different kinds of annotations on the text,\ncalled tags, marks, embedded windows or embedded images. Tags allow different\nportions of the text to be displayed with different fonts and colors. In\naddition, Tcl commands can be associated with tags so that scripts are invoked\nwhen particular actions such as keystrokes and mouse button presses occur in\nparticular ranges of the text. See TAGS below for more details.\n\nThe second form of annotation consists of floating markers in the text called\nmarks .\nMarks are used to keep track of various interesting positions in the text as\nit is edited. See MARKS below for more details.\n\nThe third form of annotation allows arbitrary windows to be embedded in a text\nwidget. See EMBEDDED WINDOWS below for more details.\n\nThe fourth form of annotation allows Tk images to be embedded in a text\nwidget. See EMBEDDED IMAGES below for more details.\n\nThe text widget also has a built-in undo/redo mechanism. See\nTHE UNDO MECHANISM below for more details.\n\nThe text widget allows for the creation of peer widgets. These are other text\nwidgets which share the same underlying data (text, marks, tags, images, etc).\nSee PEER WIDGETS below for more details.\n\nUse Window.Text to create a Text with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nAutoseparators\n\nSpecifies a boolean that says whether separators are automatically inserted in\nthe undo stack. Only meaningful when the -undo option is true.\n\nBlockcursor\n\nSpecifies a boolean that says whether the blinking insertion cursor should be\ndrawn as a character-sized rectangular block. If false (the default) a thin\nvertical line is used for the insertion cursor.\n\nEndline\n\nSpecifies an integer line index representing the line of the underlying\ntextual data store that should be just after the last line contained in\nthe widget. This allows a text widget to reflect only a portion of a\nlarger piece of text. Instead of an integer, the empty string can be\nprovided to this configuration option, which will configure the widget\nto end at the very last line in the textual data store.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies the desired height for the window, in units of characters in the\nfont given by the -font option. Must be at least one.\n\nInactiveselectbackground\n\nSpecifies the colour to use for the selection (the sel tag) when the\nwindow does not have the input focus. If empty, {}, then no selection is\nshown when the window does not have the focus.\n\nInsertunfocussed\n\nSpecifies how to display the insertion cursor when the widget does not have\nthe focus. Must be none (the default) which means to not display the\ncursor, hollow which means to display a hollow box, or solid which\nmeans to display a solid box. Note that hollow and solid will\nappear very similar when the -blockcursor option is false.\n\nMaxundo\n\nSpecifies the maximum number of compound undo actions on the undo stack. A\nzero or a negative value imply an unlimited undo stack.\n\nSpacing1\n\nRequests additional space above each text line in the widget, using any of the\nstandard forms for screen distances. If a line wraps, this option only applies\nto the first line on the display. This option may be overridden with\n-spacing1 options in tags.\n\nSpacing2\n\nFor lines that wrap (so that they cover more than one line on the display)\nthis option specifies additional space to provide between the display lines\nthat represent a single line of text. The value may have any of the standard\nforms for screen distances. This option may be overridden with\n-spacing2 options in tags.\n\nSpacing3\n\nRequests additional space below each text line in the widget, using any of the\nstandard forms for screen distances. If a line wraps, this option only applies\nto the last line on the display. This option may be overridden with\n-spacing3 options in tags.\n\nStartline\n\nSpecifies an integer line index representing the first line of the underlying\ntextual data store that should be contained in the widget. This allows a text\nwidget to reflect only a portion of a larger piece of text. Instead of an\ninteger, the empty string can be provided to this configuration option, which\nwill configure the widget to start at the very first line in the textual data\nstore.\n\nState\n\nSpecifies one of two states for the text: normal or disabled. If\nthe text is disabled then characters may not be inserted or deleted and no\ninsertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget.\n\nTabs\n\nSpecifies a set of tab stops for the window. The option's value consists of a\nlist of screen distances giving the positions of the tab stops, each of which\nis a distance relative to the left edge of the widget (excluding borders,\npadding, etc). Each position may optionally be followed in the next list\nelement by one of the keywords left, right, center, or\nnumeric, which specifies how to justify text relative to the tab stop.\nLeft is the default; it causes the text following the tab character to\nbe positioned with its left edge at the tab position. Right means that\nthe right edge of the text following the tab character is positioned at the\ntab position, and center means that the text is centered at the tab\nposition. Numeric means that the decimal point in the text is positioned\nat the tab position; if there is no decimal point then the least significant\ndigit of the number is positioned just to the left of the tab position; if\nthere is no number in the text then the text is right-justified at the tab\nposition. For example,\ncreates three tab stops at two-centimeter intervals; the first two use left\njustification and the third uses center justification.\n\nTabstyle\n\nSpecifies how to interpret the relationship between tab stops on a line and\ntabs in the text of that line. The value must be tabular (the default)\nor wordprocessor. Note that tabs are interpreted as they are encountered\nin the text. If the tab style is tabular then the n'th tab\ncharacter in the line's text will be associated with the n'th tab stop\ndefined for that line. If the tab character's x coordinate falls to the right\nof the n'th tab stop, then a gap of a single space will be inserted as a\nfallback. If the tab style is wordprocessor then any tab character being\nlaid out will use (and be defined by) the first tab stop to the right of the\npreceding characters already laid out on that line. The value of the\n-tabstyle option may be overridden by -tabstyle options in tags.\n\nUndo\n\nSpecifies a boolean that says whether the undo mechanism is active or not.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired width for the window in units of characters in the font\ngiven by the -font option. If the font does not have a uniform width\nthen the width of the character\nis used in translating from character units to screen units.\n\nWrap\n\nSpecifies how to handle lines in the text that are too long to be displayed in\na single line of the text's window. The value must be none or char\nor word. A wrap mode of none means that each line of text appears\nas exactly one line on the screen; extra characters that do not fit on the\nscreen are not displayed. In the other modes each line of text will be broken\nup into several screen lines if necessary to keep all the characters visible.\nIn char mode a screen line break may occur after any character; in\nword mode a line break will only be made at word boundaries.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nClear makes 'w' empty.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nCopies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nCounts the number of relevant things between the two indices. If index1 is\nafter index2, the result will be a negative number (and this holds for each\nof the possible options). The actual items which are counted depend on the\noptions given. The result is a list of integers, one for the result of each\ncounting option given. Valid counting options are -chars, -displaychars,\n-displayindices, -displaylines, -indices, -lines, -xpixels and -ypixels. The\ndefault value, if no option is specified, is -indices. There is an\nadditional possible option -update which is a modifier. If given (and if the\ntext widget is managed by a geometry manager), then all subsequent options\nensure that any possible out of date information is recalculated. This\ncurrently only has any effect for the -ypixels count (which, if -update is\nnot given, will use the text widget's current cached value for each line).\nThis -update option is obsoleted by pathName sync, pathName pendingsync and\n\u003c\u003cWidgetViewSync\u003e\u003e. The count options are interpreted as follows:\n\nThe command returns a positive or negative integer corresponding to the\nnumber of items counted between the two indices. One such integer is\nreturned for each counting option given, so a list is returned if more than\none option was supplied. For example “.text count -xpixels -ypixels 1.3 4.5”\nis perfectly valid and will return a list of two elements.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nCopies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the\nselection. If there is no selection in the widget then these keys have no\neffect.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nDelete a range of characters from the text. If both index1 and index2 are\nspecified, then delete all the characters starting with the one given by\nindex1 and stopping just before index2 (i.e. the character at index2 is not\ndeleted). If index2 does not specify a position later in the text than\nindex1 then no characters are deleted. If index2 is not specified then the\nsingle character at index1 is deleted. Attempts to delete characters in a\nway that would leave the text without a newline as the last character will\nbe tweaked by the text widget to avoid this. In particular, deletion of\ncomplete lines of text up to the end of the text will also delete the\nnewline character just before the deleted block so that it is replaced by\nthe new final newline of the text widget. The command returns an empty\nstring. If more indices are given, multiple ranges of text will be deleted.\nAll indices are first checked for validity before any deletions are made.\nThey are sorted and the text is removed from the last range to the first\nrange so deleted text does not cause an undesired index shifting\nside-effects. If multiple ranges with the same start index are given, then\nthe longest range is used. If overlapping ranges are given, then they will\nbe merged into spans that do not cause deletion of text outside the given\nranges due to text shifted during deletion.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nClears the undo and redo stacks.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturn a range of characters from the text. The return value will be all the\ncharacters in the text starting with the one whose index is index1 and\nending just before the one whose index is index2 (the character at index2\nwill not be returned). If index2 is omitted then the single character at\nindex1 is returned. If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g.\nindex1 is past the end of the file or index2 is less than or equal to\nindex1) then an empty string is returned. If the specified range contains\nembedded windows, no information about them is included in the returned\nstring. If multiple index pairs are given, multiple ranges of text will be\nreturned in a list. Invalid ranges will not be represented with empty\nstrings in the list. The ranges are returned in the order passed to pathName\nget. If the -displaychars option is given, then, within each range, only\nthose characters which are not elided will be returned. This may have the\neffect that some of the returned ranges are empty strings.\n\nBUG(jnml) TextWidget.Get currently supports only one range.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nThis command creates a new image annotation, which will appear in the text\nat the position given by index. Any number of option-value pairs may be\nspecified to configure the annotation. Returns a unique identifier that may\nbe used as an index to refer to this image. See EMBEDDED IMAGES for\ninformation on the options that are supported, and a description of the\nidentifier returned.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturns the position corresponding to index in the form line.char where line\nis the line number and char is the character number. Index may have any of\nthe forms described under INDICES above.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nInserts all of the chars arguments just before the character at index. If\nindex refers to the end of the text (the character after the last newline)\nthen the new text is inserted just before the last newline instead. If there\nis a single chars argument and no tagList, then the new text will receive\nany tags that are present on both the character before and the character\nafter the insertion point; if a tag is present on only one of these\ncharacters then it will not be applied to the new text. If tagList is\nspecified then it consists of a list of tag names; the new characters will\nreceive all of the tags in this list and no others, regardless of the tags\npresent around the insertion point. If multiple chars-tagList argument pairs\nare present, they produce the same effect as if a separate pathName insert\nwidget command had been issued for each pair, in order. The last tagList\nargument may be omitted.\n\nThe value that is passed to Tcl/Tk for the 'index' argument is obtained by\nfmt.Sprint(index), enabling any custom index encoding via implementing\nfmt.Stringer.\n\nMany of the widget commands for texts take one or more indices as arguments.\nAn index is a string used to indicate a particular place within a text, such\nas a place to insert characters or one endpoint of a range of characters to\ndelete. Indices have the syntax\n\nWhere base gives a starting point and the modifiers adjust the index from\nthe starting point (e.g. move forward or backward one character). Every\nindex must contain a base, but the modifiers are optional. Most modifiers\n(as documented below) allow an optional submodifier. Valid submodifiers are\nany and display. If the submodifier is abbreviated, then it must be followed\nby whitespace, but otherwise there need be no space between the submodifier\nand the following modifier. Typically the display submodifier adjusts the\nmeaning of the following modifier to make it refer to visual or non-elided\nunits rather than logical units, but this is explained for each relevant\ncase below. Lastly, where count is used as part of a modifier, it can be\npositive or negative, so “base - -3 lines” is perfectly valid (and\nequivalent to “base +3lines”).\n\nThe base for an index must have one of the following forms:\n\nIndicates char'th character on line line. Lines are numbered from 1 for\nconsistency with other UNIX programs that use this numbering scheme. Within\na line, characters are numbered from 0. If char is end then it refers to the\nnewline character that ends the line.\n\nThis form of index can be passed as LC{line, char}.\n\nIndicates the character that covers the pixel whose x and y coordinates\nwithin the text's window are x and y.\n\nIndicates the end of the text (the character just after the last newline).\n\nIndicates the character just after the mark whose name is mark (see MARKS\nfor details).\n\nIndicates the first character in the text that has been tagged with tag.\nThis form generates an error if no characters are currently tagged with tag.\n\nIndicates the character just after the last one in the text that has been\ntagged with tag. This form generates an error if no characters are currently\ntagged with tag.\n\nIndicates the position of the embedded window whose name is pathName. This\nform generates an error if there is no embedded window by the given name.\n\nIndicates the position of the embedded image whose name is imageName. This\nform generates an error if there is no embedded image by the given name.\n\nIf the base could match more than one of the above forms, such as a mark and\nimageName both having the same value, then the form earlier in the above\nlist takes precedence. If modifiers follow the base index, each one of them\nmust have one of the forms listed below. Keywords such as chars and wordend\nmay be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.\n\nAdjust the index forward by count characters, moving to later lines in the\ntext if necessary. If there are fewer than count characters in the text\nafter the current index, then set the index to the last index in the text.\nSpaces on either side of count are optional. If the display submodifier is\ngiven, elided characters are skipped over without being counted. If any is\ngiven, then all characters are counted. For historical reasons, if neither\nmodifier is given then the count actually takes place in units of index\npositions (see INDICES for details). This behaviour may be changed in a\nfuture major release, so if you need an index count, you are encouraged to\nuse indices instead wherever possible.\n\nAdjust the index backward by count characters, moving to earlier lines in\nthe text if necessary. If there are fewer than count characters in the text\nbefore the current index, then set the index to the first index in the text\n(1.0). Spaces on either side of count are optional. If the display\nsubmodifier is given, elided characters are skipped over without being\ncounted. If any is given, then all characters are counted. For historical\nreasons, if neither modifier is given then the count actually takes place in\nunits of index positions (see INDICES for details). This behavior may be\nchanged in a future major release, so if you need an index count, you are\nencouraged to use indices instead wherever possible.\n\nAdjust the index forward by count index positions, moving to later lines in\nthe text if necessary. If there are fewer than count index positions in the\ntext after the current index, then set the index to the last index position\nin the text. Spaces on either side of count are optional. Note that an index\nposition is either a single character or a single embedded image or embedded\nwindow. If the display submodifier is given, elided indices are skipped over\nwithout being counted. If any is given, then all indices are counted; this\nis also the default behaviour if no modifier is given.\n\nAdjust the index backward by count index positions, moving to earlier lines\nin the text if necessary. If there are fewer than count index positions in\nthe text before the current index, then set the index to the first index\nposition (1.0) in the text. Spaces on either side of count are optional. If\nthe display submodifier is given, elided indices are skipped over without\nbeing counted. If any is given, then all indices are counted; this is also\nthe default behaviour if no modifier is given.\n\nAdjust the index forward by count lines, retaining the same character\nposition within the line. If there are fewer than count lines after the line\ncontaining the current index, then set the index to refer to the same\ncharacter position on the last line of the text. Then, if the line is not\nlong enough to contain a character at the indicated character position,\nadjust the character position to refer to the last character of the line\n(the newline). Spaces on either side of count are optional. If the display\nsubmodifier is given, then each visual display line is counted separately.\nOtherwise, if any (or no modifier) is given, then each logical line (no\nmatter how many times it is visually wrapped) counts just once. If the\nrelevant lines are not wrapped, then these two methods of counting are\nequivalent.\n\nAdjust the index backward by count logical lines, retaining the same\ncharacter position within the line. If there are fewer than count lines\nbefore the line containing the current index, then set the index to refer to\nthe same character position on the first line of the text. Then, if the line\nis not long enough to contain a character at the indicated character\nposition, adjust the character position to refer to the last character of\nthe line (the newline). Spaces on either side of count are optional. If the\ndisplay submodifier is given, then each visual display line is counted\nseparately. Otherwise, if any (or no modifier) is given, then each logical\nline (no matter how many times it is visually wrapped) counts just once. If\nthe relevant lines are not wrapped, then these two methods of counting are\nequivalent.\n\nAdjust the index to refer to the first index on the line. If the display\nsubmodifier is given, this is the first index on the display line, otherwise\non the logical line.\n\nAdjust the index to refer to the last index on the line (the newline). If\nthe display submodifier is given, this is the last index on the display\nline, otherwise on the logical line.\n\nAdjust the index to refer to the first character of the word containing the\ncurrent index. A word consists of any number of adjacent characters that are\nletters, digits, or underscores, or a single character that is not one of\nthese. If the display submodifier is given, this only examines non-elided\ncharacters, otherwise all characters (elided or not) are examined.\n\nAdjust the index to refer to the character just after the last one of the\nword containing the current index. If the current index refers to the last\ncharacter of the text then it is not modified. If the display submodifier is\ngiven, this only examines non-elided characters, otherwise all characters\n(elided or not) are examined.\n\nIf more than one modifier is present then they are applied in left-to-right\norder. For example, the index “end - 1 chars” refers to the next-to-last\ncharacter in the text and “insert wordstart - 1 c” refers to the character\njust before the first one in the word containing the insertion cursor.\nModifiers are applied one by one in this left to right order, and after each\nstep the resulting index is constrained to be a valid index in the text\nwidget. So, for example, the index “1.0 -1c +1c” refers to the index “2.0”.\n\nWhere modifiers result in index changes by display lines, display chars or\ndisplay indices, and the base refers to an index inside an elided tag, that\nbase index is considered to be equivalent to the first following non-elided\nindex.\n\nInsert returns its index argument.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nInsertML inserts 'ml' at the end of 'w', interpreting it as a HTML-like\nmarkup language.\n\nIt recognizes and treats accordingly the \u003cbr\u003e tag.\n\nThe \u003cimg\u003e tag is reserved for embedded images.

A\nsingle command may contain any number of index1-index2 pairs. If the last\nindex2 is omitted then the single character at index1 is tagged. If there\nare no characters in the specified range (e.g. index1 is past the end of the\nfile or index2 is less than or equal to index1) then the command has no\neffect.\n\nThe function returns the new tag name.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nThis command associates a script with the tag given by tagName. Whenever the\nevent sequence given by sequence occurs for a character that has been tagged\nwith tagName, the script will be invoked. This widget command is similar to\nthe bind command except that it operates on characters in a text rather than\nentire widgets. See the bind manual entry for complete details on the syntax\nof sequence and the substitutions performed on script before invoking it.\nA new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same sequence and tagName.\nThe only events for which\nbindings may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard (such\nas Enter, Leave, Button, Motion, and Key) or virtual events. Mouse and\nkeyboard event bindings for a text widget respectively use the current and\ninsert marks described under MARKS above. An Enter event triggers for a tag\nwhen the tag first becomes present on the current character, and a Leave\nevent triggers for a tag when it ceases to be present on the current\ncharacter. Enter and Leave events can happen either because the current mark\nmoved or because the character at that position changed. Note that these\nevents are different than Enter and Leave events for windows. Mouse events\nare directed to the current character, while keyboard events are directed to\nthe insert character. If a virtual event is used in a binding, that binding\ncan trigger only if the virtual event is defined by an underlying\nmouse-related or keyboard-related event.\n\nIt is possible for the current character to have multiple tags, and for each\nof them to have a binding for a particular event sequence. When this occurs,\none binding is invoked for each tag, in order from lowest-priority to\nhighest priority. If there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag,\nthen the most specific binding is chosen (see the manual entry for the bind\ncommand for details). continue and break commands within binding scripts are\nprocessed in the same way as for bindings created with the bind command.\n\nIf bindings are created for the widget as a whole using the bind command,\nthen those bindings will supplement the tag bindings. The tag bindings will\nbe invoked first, followed by bindings for the window as a whole.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nThis command is similar to the pathName configure widget command except that\nit modifies options associated with the tag given by tagName instead of\nmodifying options for the overall text widget. If no option is specified,\nthe command returns a list describing all of the available options for\ntagName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this list).\nIf option is specified with no value, then the command returns a list\ndescribing the one named option (this list will be identical to the\ncorresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is specified). If\none or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies the\ngiven option(s) to have the given value(s) in tagName; in this case the\ncommand returns an empty string. See TAGS above for details on the options\navailable for tags.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nDeletes all tag information for each of the tagName arguments. The command\nremoves the tags from all characters in the file and also deletes any other\ninformation associated with the tags, such as bindings and display\ninformation. The command returns an empty string.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturns a list whose elements are the names of all the tags that are active\nat the character position given by index. If index is omitted, then the\nreturn value will describe all of the tags that exist for the text (this\nincludes all tags that have been named in a “pathName tag” widget command\nbut have not been deleted by a “pathName tag delete” widget command, even if\nno characters are currently marked with the tag). The list will be sorted in\norder from lowest priority to highest priority.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturns a list describing all of the ranges of text that have been tagged\nwith tagName. The first two elements of the list describe the first tagged\nrange in the text, the next two elements describe the second range, and so\non. The first element of each pair contains the index of the first character\nof the range, and the second element of the pair contains the index of the\ncharacter just after the last one in the range. If there are no characters\ntagged with tag then an empty string is returned.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText is a shortcut for w.Get(\"1.0\", \"end-1c\")[0].\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nUndoes the last edit action when the -undo option is true, and returns a\nlist of indices indicating what ranges were changed by the undo operation.\nAn edit action is defined as all the insert and delete commands that are\nrecorded on the undo stack in between two separators. Generates an error\nwhen the undo stack is empty. Does nothing when the -undo option is false.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nThis command creates a new window annotation, which will appear in the text\nat the position given by index. Any number of option-value pairs may be\nspecified to configure the annotation. See EMBEDDED WINDOWS for information\non the options that are supported. Returns an empty string.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions\nbetween 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the first visible\npixel of the first character (or image, etc) in the top line in the window,\nrelative to the text as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the text,\nfor example). The second element gives the position of the first pixel just\nafter the last visible one in the bottom line of the window, relative to the\ntext as a whole. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the\n-xscrollcommand option.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nReturns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions\nbetween 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the first visible\npixel of the first character (or image, etc) in the top line in the window,\nrelative to the text as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the text,\nfor example). The second element gives the position of the first pixel just\nafter the last visible one in the bottom line of the window, relative to the\ntext as a whole. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the\n-yscrollcommand option.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nText — Create and manipulate 'text' hypertext editing widgets\n\nAdjusts the view in the window so that the pixel given by fraction appears\nat the top of the top line of the window. Fraction is a fraction between 0\nand 1; 0 indicates the first pixel of the first character in the text, 0.33\nindicates the pixel that is one-third the way through the text; and so on.\nValues close to 1 will indicate values close to the last pixel in the text\n(1 actually refers to one pixel beyond the last pixel), but in such cases\nthe widget will never scroll beyond the last pixel, and so a value of 1 will\neffectively be rounded back to whatever fraction ensures the last pixel is\nat the bottom of the window, and some other pixel is at the top.\n\nAdditional information might be available at the Tcl/Tk text page.\n\nTheme provides handling of a Tk theme. When calling Theme methods registered\nin Theme, the context argument is ignored and an instance is created\nautomatically.\n\nCurrentTheme returns the currently activated theme, if any.\n\nThemeContext provides context to Theme methods.\n\nThemeKey indexes Themes\n\nRegisterTheme registers t.\n\nToplevelWidget represents the Tcl/Tk toplevel widget/window\n\nToplevel — Create and manipulate 'toplevel' main and popup window widgets\n\nThe toplevel command creates a new toplevel widget (given\nby the pathName argument).  Additional\noptions, described above, may be specified on the command line\nor in the option database\nto configure aspects of the toplevel such as its background color\nand relief.  The toplevel command returns the\npath name of the new window.\n\nA toplevel is similar to a frame except that it is created as a\ntop-level window:  its X parent is the root window of a screen\nrather than the logical parent from its Tk path name.  The primary\npurpose of a toplevel is to serve as a container for dialog boxes\nand other collections of widgets.  The only visible features\nof a toplevel are its background and an optional 3-D border\nto make the toplevel appear raised or sunken.\n\nUse Window.Toplevel to create a Toplevel with a particular parent.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk toplevel page.\n\nBackground\n\nThis option is the same as the standard -background option\nexcept that its value may also be specified as an empty string.\nIn this case, the widget will display no background or border, and\nno colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background\nand border.\nAn empty background will disable drawing the background image.\n\nBackgroundimage\n\nThis specifies an image to display on the toplevel's background within\nthe border of the toplevel (i.e., the image will be clipped by the\ntoplevel's highlight ring and border, if either are present) on top of\nthe background;\nsubwidgets of the toplevel will be drawn on top. The image must have\nbeen created with the image create command. If specified as the\nempty string, no image will be displayed.\n\nClass\n\nSpecifies a class for the window.\nThis class will be used when querying the option database for\nthe window's other options, and it will also be used later for\nother purposes such as bindings. Some window managers display the\nclass name for windows in their dock while some others display the\nwindow title.\nThe -class option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nColormap\n\nSpecifies a colormap to use for the window.\nThe value may be either new, in which case a new colormap is\ncreated for the window and its children, or the name of another\nwindow (which must be on the same screen and have the same visual\nas pathName), in which case the new window will use the colormap\nfrom the specified window.\nIf the -colormap option is not specified, the new window\nuses the default colormap of its screen.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nContainer\n\nThe value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will\nbe used as a container in which some other application will be embedded\n(for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the -use option).\nThe window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for\nthings like geometry requests.  The window should not have any\nchildren of its own in this application.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nHeight\n\nSpecifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this option is negative or zero then the window will\nnot request any size at all.\n\nMnu\n\nSpecifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the Macintosh, the\nmenubar will be displayed across the top of the main monitor. On\nMicrosoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will appear across\nthe toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the\nwindow manager.\n\nScreen\n\nSpecifies the screen on which to place the new window.\nAny valid screen name may be used, even one associated with a\ndifferent display.\nDefaults to the same screen as its parent.\nThis option is special in that it may not be specified via the option\ndatabase, and it may not be modified with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nTile\n\nThis specifies how to draw the background image (see\n-backgroundimage) on the toplevel.\nIf true (according to Tcl_GetBoolean), the image will be tiled\nto fill the whole toplevel, with the origin of the first copy of the\nimage being the top left of the interior of the toplevel.\nIf false (the default), the image will be centered within the toplevel.\n\nUse\n\nThis option is used for embedding. If the value is not an empty string,\nit must be the window identifier of a container window, specified as\na hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the winfo id\ncommand. The toplevel widget will be created as a child of the given\ncontainer instead of the root window for the screen.  If the container\nwindow is in a Tk application, it must be a frame or toplevel widget for\nwhich the -container option was specified.\nThis option may not be changed with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nVisual\n\nSpecifies visual information for the new window in any of the\nforms accepted by Tk_GetVisual.\nIf this option is not specified, the new window will use the default\nvisual for its screen.\nThe -visual option may not be modified with the configure\nwidget command.\n\nWidth\n\nSpecifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms\nacceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\nIf this option is negative or zero then the window will\nnot request any size at all.\n\nVariableOpt is an Opt linking Go and Tcl variables.\n\nVariable option.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nGet return the value of the linked Tcl variable.\n\nSet sets the value of the linked Tcl variable.\n\nWidget is implemented by every *Window\n\nWidget implements Opt. When a Widget instance is used as an Opt, it provides\nits path name.\n\ntooltip — Tooltip management\n\nThis command arranges for widget 'w' to display a tooltip with a\nmessage.\n\nIf the specified widget is a menu, canvas, listbox, ttk::treeview,\nttk::notebook or text widget then additional options are used to tie the\ntooltip to specific menu, canvas or listbox items, ttk::treeview items or\ncolumn headings, ttk::notebook tabs, or text widget tags.\n\nHeading columnId: This option is used to set a tooltip for a\nttk::treeview column heading. The column does not need to already exist.\nYou should not use the same identifiers for columns and items in a widget\nfor which you are using tooltips as their tooltips will be mixed. The\nwidget must be a ttk::treeview widget.\n\nImage image: The specified (photo) image will be displayed to the left\nof the primary tooltip message.\n\nIndex index: This option is used to set a tooltip on a menu item. The\nindex may be either the entry index or the entry label. The widget must be\na menu widget but the entries do not have to exist when the tooltip is\nset.\n\nInfo info: The specified info text will be displayed as additional\ninformation below the primary tooltip message.\n\nItems items: This option is used to set a tooltip for canvas, listbox\nor ttk::treview items. For the canvas widget, the item must already be\npresent in the canvas and will be found with a find withtag lookup. For\nlistbox and ttk::treview widgets the item(s) may be created later but the\nprogrammer is responsible for managing the link between the listbox or\nttk::treview item index and the corresponding tooltip. If the listbox or\nttk::treview items are re-ordered, the tooltips will need amending.\n\nIf the widget is not a canvas, listbox or ttk::treview then an error is\nraised.\n\nTab tabId: The -tab option can be used to set a tooltip for a\nttk::notebook tab. The tab should already be present when this command is\ncalled, or an error will be returned. The widget must be a ttk::notebook\nwidget.\n\nTag name: The -tag option can be used to set a tooltip for a text\nwidget tag. The tag should already be present when this command is called,\nor an error will be returned. The widget must be a text widget.\n\n\"--\": The -- option marks the end of options. The argument following\nthis one will be treated as message even if it starts with a -.\n\nTooltip returns 'w'.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tklib tooltip page.\n\nWindow represents a Tk window/widget.

The data in the images is taken as a snapshot at the time of\ninvocation. If the images are later changed, this is not reflected to the\ntitlebar icons. Multiple images are accepted to allow different images sizes\n(e.g., 16x16 and 32x32) to be provided. The window manager may scale\nprovided icons to an appropriate size.\n\nOn Windows, the images are packed into a Windows icon structure. This will\noverride an ico specified to wm iconbitmap, and vice versa. This command\nsets the taskbar icon for the window.\n\nOn X, the images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X property, which most\nmodern window managers support. A wm iconbitmap may exist simultaneously. It is\nrecommended to use not more than 2 icons, placing the larger icon first. This\ncommand also sets the panel icon for the application if the window manager or\ndesktop environment supports it.\n\nOn Macintosh, the first image called is loaded into an OSX-native icon\nformat, and becomes the application icon in dialogs, the Dock, and other\ncontexts. At the script level the command will accept only the first image\npassed in the parameters as support for multiple sizes/resolutions on macOS\nis outside Tk's scope. Developers should use the largest icon they can\nsupport (preferably 512 pixels) to ensure smooth rendering on the Mac.\n\nMore information might be available at the Tcl/Tk wm page.\n\nImage — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInactiveselectbackground — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nIncrement — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nIndicatoron — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertbackground — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertborderwidth — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertofftime — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertontime — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertunfocussed — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nInsertwidth — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nJump — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nJustify — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nLabel — Create and manipulate 'label' non-interactive text or image widgets\n\nThe resulting Window is a child of 'w'\n\nFor details please see Label\n\nLabelanchor — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nLabelframe — Create and manipulate 'labelframe' labelled container widgets\n\nThe resulting Window is a child of 'w'\n\nFor details please see Labelframe\n\nLabelwidget — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nLbl — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nLength — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nListbox — Create and manipulate 'listbox' item list widgets\n\nThe resulting Window is a child of 'w'\n\nFor details please see Listbox\n\nListvariable — Get the configured option value.\n\nKnown uses:\n\nLower — Change a window's position in the stacking order\n\nIf the belowThis argument is nil then the command lowers window so that\nit is below all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will be obscured\nby any siblings that overlap it and will not obscure any siblings).

    "content": "The slow rise of Wayland hasn’t really been slow anymore for years now, and today another major part of the Linux ecosystem is making the jump from X to Wayland.\nSo we made the decision to switch. For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process with the developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us immensely with their support as we contribute features and optimisations needed for our desktop.\nAfter much optimisation for our hardware, we have reached the point where labwc desktops run just as fast as X on older Raspberry Pi models. Today, we make the switch with our latest desktop image: Raspberry Pi Desktop now runs Wayland by default across all models.\nRaspberry Pi Desktop already used Wayland on some of the newer models, through the use of Wayfire. However, it turned out Wayfire wasn’t a good fit for the older Pi models, and Wayfire’x development direction would move it even further away from that goal, which is obviously important to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They eventually settled on using labwc instead, which can also be used on older Pi models. As such, all Pi models will now switch to using Wayland with the latest update to the operating system.\nThis new update also brings vastly improved touchscreen support, a rewritten panel application that won’t keep removed plugins in memory, a new display configuration utility, and more.\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @[email protected]\nI have long (\u003e2,5 years) been using Wayland on all of my graphics-enabled Raspberries, with no glitches. In fact, I switched my main environment over to Wayland precisely because it vastly outperformed X on my ARM hardware (the raspberries, but most important, my Lenovo C630 laptop). Not a glitch… Never looked back.\nAs someone who’s experienced the wayland problems, I’m not opposed to this switch as long as things are working. All of my gripes with wayland were pragmatic in nature. Reports suggest the latest version of KDE should solve the last of my wayland issues, and if so that’s great! I’m just waiting for it to come down the debian stable pipeline. I also have some Cinnamon and xfce desktops, those might take more time before being ready. I really wish screen sharing would have been a global wayland feature that just worked everywhere like in X. Alas, it is what it is.\nThey do always seem to gloss over the legacy issues and focus on look we fixed the latest and greatest. I understand that, but it’s not going to help me or get more of my users on Linux. I must have a bullet proof OOB RDC solution that doesn’t need a PhD to implement.\nFWIW, I’ve been using Wayland on both a Pi 4 \u0026 5 for quite a while now, I’ll have to test the update on the older model and see if the claims stack up.\nSo as promised I tried several Raspberry PI 4 and 5 devices all operating headless needing remote terminal and RDC. I tested with the native Pi client as well as several commonly used 3rd party solutions, not a single combination worked reliably and not one functioned for more than 3 hrs without failing.\nFurthermore, switching to LabWC broke many previous OS features that had been working flawlessly for many months on end, and on some older but very common hardware 3rd party drivers failed rendering various expansion like cases and hats with M.2 or PoE disabled.\nSucked in again!\nSo I’ll spend the next day hopefully reverting to X via raspi-config without the need to re-image boot devices.\ncpcf,\nSucked in again!\nSo I’ll spend the next day hopefully reverting to X via raspi-config without the need to re-image boot devices.\nI haven’t tried this on rpi, but this process is familiar to me on my computers. I genuinely hope the problems are sorted, but I’ve stopped proactively checking claims. After all my systems are working fine with X and there’s no pressing reason to switch. The next attempt for me will probably be when debian stable includes the next version of KDE.\nAside, I have a question for you: does RPI5 performs well enough to be useable as a real desktop?\nI’ve been impressed with just how much linux software works on ARM, but the performance was never really on par.\n@Alfman\nI should have known better.\nRegarding the RPi 5 as a desktop, I’d say no, in that a ten year old Core i3 or i5 outperforms the RPi 5 comfortably, I’ve even got a 2008 Core 2 Duo I keep here for reference and I’d say that is still more performant than the RPi 5 as well. Of course they all suck down energy at a vastly greater rate.\nMy main reason for using the RPi is as a test platform for industrial sensor / control applications, we put them in place and lock them down serving up their own data analysis. As an aside, we’ll be moving to the 2350 due to built in security features.\ncpcf,\nRegarding the RPi 5 as a desktop, I’d say no, in that a ten year old Core i3 or i5 outperforms the RPi 5 comfortably, I’ve even got a 2008 Core 2 Duo I keep here for reference and I’d say that is still more performant than the RPi 5 as well.\nThat’s my experience with RPI4, but I didn’t know if it was still the case for RPI5. There are a lot of alternatives to RPI, with better hardware and enclosures but then you take on the risk of bad support. Overall I’d say the ARM ecosystem gets a failing grade here. This is why, even though I do like the efficiency of ARM, I still end up buying x86 minipcs instead.\nMy main reason for using the RPi is as a test platform for industrial sensor / control applications, we put them in place and lock them down serving up their own data analysis.\nYes, this is exactly where ARM SBCs really shine. I bought several rpi zero-w for this purpose. Much faster than a microcontroller with the benefit of a genuine linux stack.\nThis is the kind of progress I like to see with Wayland! It’s good to know that labwc is performant on older/slower hardware as well.\nNow if only the Wayland devs can start caring about essential protocols like RDC, that’s the only real blocker for me to switch to using it daily. Right now all RDC clients I’ve tried under Wayland fail to render the remote desktop.\n@Morgan\nYes let’s hope so, I’m keen to give it a try but because I’ve heard this all before(old hardware performance improvements) I’ll reserve my opinion. Until RDC works reliably it’s a no go for me on anything but the test beds.\nSo 16 years after initial release yet another of the GNU/Linux players decided to make a switch to Wayland. On where each and every project needs to do that on their own. Great, isn’t it? Perfect strategy to hold GNU/Linux on desktop back? Pure perfection.\nWell, not every project needs to implement Wayland… The main distributions need to. Other than that, only if yours implements a graphical environment completely of its own, you will have any issues adapting.\nDebian has long shipped Wayland by default on some desktop environments (IIRC, for GNOME it has been the default since Debian 11, or maybe even 10). OK, maybe at the beginning it was a bit bumpy, as some use cases were no longer supported (i.e. remote desktop, which I happen to use). But things have smoothed out.\nRaspberry Pi OS is a Debian derivative. They do modify their graphical environment, although not fundamentally; it was logical for them to change, as it’s no longer sensible for them to keep delaying the step.\nMATE is getting closer, I’m running it fully in Wayland mode now. There’s a few rough edges to smooth out but it’s already very usable.\nAny chance of a news covering on why Wayland failed to deliver? As we still seem to get articles written in denial, on how it’s a best thing after sliced bread and just about any time now it will take off. Some in depth article on why it failed from technical, governance, idea point of view, on why it isn’t used in lets say Android … To get some idea on what is wrong with Wayland, to hopefully improve on that and for being able to move forward. Wasting another decade before doing that is in my opinion not a good thing to do.\nJust open your text editor and write something better.\nSo i guess anybody can be a journalist and writer these days? I mean i could do that but i would much rather prefer if it would be done with people having much deeper knowledge into this subject. For example i can only assume on why Wayland was never being considered for Android, some people out there know, for a fact, on why. Then i read things like we don’t want for Wayland to become another Xorg, that is one solution for all and instead each project should do their own implementation. It seems this strategy is failing so people that actually want to keep it like it is, one would need to interview them, as a basis for such article? On why. This is a job for some more prominent journalist, isn’t it? If there is to be some weight behind it. As the goal would be to try to improve in the future, as this can’t be it? 16 years later and nobody rally happy with it. Dangling. Or is this it, as good as it gets and that is that, as it was imagined? We should be happy?\nGeck,\nX11 is old and bloated, so I didn’t really have an issue replacing it. But wayland shot themselves in the foot with bad execution. They should have been listening to user needs up front and reevaluated breaking critical features. The covid stay at home mandates required millions of employees to have access to remote desktop and wayland desktops had objectively failed us. At least now those gaps are being filled, but better management could have solved a lot of user problems a lot sooner. Oh well, it will all be forgotten and we’ll move on.\nWrite something better than Wayland. Get coding and stop complaining on the internet.\nThat’s not how it works. If someone paints graffiti on your house, you don’t tell the owner “if you don’t like it paint something better”.\nIt is time developers realised the have responsibility to the community and they can cause considerable damage.\nGnome3 sent Linux desktop back a decade (mostly by abandoning the Linux desktop of the time – Gnome 2). Wayland is on track of doing the same and fragmenting Linux desktos into multiple incompatible OSes. A profit funded company would have killed a project within a year.\nI wonder if Gnome or Wayland teams are getting any funding from MS or Google. Correction: Google does sponsor Gnome Foundation. I guess that’s peanuts for keeping Linux desktop divided.\nInitial Wayland deployments were either Wayland demos showing off fading transitions or round window corners (BTW, all Wayland features could have been implemented with a few X11 extensions) or walled-garden DEs written with disregard to desktop usability conventions and interoperability.\nAn actual progress is happening now, driven by people who want to build usable DEs, or simply port existing ones. It is an ugly process with a lot of infighting between thinly wailed hostile factions. I expect it to take a better part of a decade and things will get a lot worse before getting better.\nWe will likely end up with hybrid X11/Wayland desktops, with applications/toolkits supporting both and features being gradually unified. This is happening already – XWayland is becoming tightly integrated with compositors and there is a good reason for it: a compositor is acting as a display server to XWayland and at the same time it is being its X11 client (a window manager). Ideally both would be in the same executable, using the same mainloop.\nHelp keep OSNews alive!\n",

    "content": "Jim Zemlin: \"You must be genuinely helpful to developers. We're the janitors of open source.\"\nNAPA, Calif. -- Some people love The Linux Foundation. Others hate it. Some folks see the organization as leading open-source projects into the future, while others resent it because of its corporate connections. What everyone agrees on, though, is that by overseeing more than 1,000 open-source projects, the Foundation can't be ignored. That presence is, in large part, because of executive director Jim Zemlin's outstanding leadership.  \nWhen I first met Zemlin, he was the head of the Free Standards Group (FSG). The FSG's main project was the Linux Standard Base (LSB) project. The LSB's goal was to get everyone in the Linux desktop world to agree on standards to ensure compatibility among distributions and their applications. Oh well, some struggles are never-ending.   \nAlso: My Linux predictions for 2025: It's going to be a good year\nAnother group, the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), was simultaneously working on standardizing enterprise Linux. The two non-profits had the same goal of making Linux more useful and popular, so they agreed to merge. Zemlin was the natural pick to head this new group, which would be called The Linux Foundation.    \nAt the time, he told me: \"The combination of the two groups really enables the Linux platform and all the members of the Linux Foundation to work really effectively. I clearly understand what the organization's charter needs to be: We need to provide services that are useful to the community and industry, as well as protect, promote, and continue to standardize the platform.\" \nAchievement unlocked.   \nWhile initially focused on Linux, the Foundation's scope expanded significantly around 2010. Until then, the organization had hosted about a dozen projects related to the Linux operating system. However, as Linux gained dominance in various sectors, including high-performance computing, automotive, embedded systems, mobile devices, and cloud computing, the Linux Foundation started to broaden its horizons.  \nJim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation.\nAlso: 10 lessons I've learned from the open-source community that aren't about tech\nTwenty years after he started leading the FSB, at the Linux Foundation Members Summit, Zemlin recalled how the Foundation became a \"foundation of foundations\", supporting developers and communities that wanted to leverage open source.  \nLong before Linux was a twinkle in Linus Torvalds' eye, Zemlin's grandfather had been a co-founder of one of the first supercomputer companies, Cray Research. He also recalled how his grandmother founded a non-profit in the 1950s that helped disabled adults get vocational training. His career seemed destined from the start to be in technology non-profits. Zemlin recalled: \n\"The Linux Standard Base had goods and starts. I think it did really good work in promoting Linux and getting it to the next level. Red Hat also did its share of consolidating a lot of the enterprise Linux market and standardizing it in a market-driven way. But it was such an amazing start where I was working on this sort of quirky open-source problem, and I thought, 'Ah, maybe I'll do this for a couple of years,' but then I just kind of fell in love with the people in the open-source community. You know, any of you who've been in open source long enough know how infectious and enthusiastic the open-source community can be, way beyond what you're actually working on, and so it was just something I fell in love with.\"  \t\nZelim also said: \"It's funny to look back at 2004 when Ubuntu had their first release. Firefox had its first release. Ruby on Rails had their first release. MySpace was used quite a lot. You know, the MySpace reference just makes me feel old. As many of you know, I'm not super hip on social media. If anybody wants a Clubhouse invitation, just let me know.\"\nIt was also the year that Zemlin became Linus Torvalds' boss. Not, mind you -- he said -- that Linus pays him much attention.    \nMore seriously, Zemlin sees Linux and open-source software as having gone through three stages. First, \"open-source development was very anti-establishment. It was really a way to emulate existing proprietary software. We're going to be a free and open alternative to Windows via a free and open alternative to database technology. Open source was seen as this counter to incumbent proprietary software.\"  \nAlso: How to run a Windows app on Linux with Wine\nThen, in the 2010s, \"Open source became where big shifts in technology, whether it's software-defined networking, container technology, cloud computing, or mobile technology, started. Open source was the vehicle for innovation, particularly in AI. During this period, organizations, big tech companies, and little tech companies all realized that this is an amazing resource and that you not only go to market quickly by utilizing open source building blocks, but you can really do a lot of innovation.\"  \nThis was when open source became programming's dominant paradigm. According to a recent Harvard Business School study, Zemlin remarked that it would cost almost $9 trillion -- not billion, trillion dollars -- to create the work of open source from scratch.  \nHowever, Zemlin said we're now entering a new period. In the 2020s, \"there is a lot more scrutiny being applied to open-source technology. It started with regulators worrying about cybersecurity threats. We also saw a huge increase in intellectual property (IP) legal claims, with patent trolls coming out of the woodwork. Now, the Linux Foundation and open-source software, in general, must deal with legal attacks and regulations.\" Looking ahead, the Linux Foundation, he said, \"needs to be the supporting cast to build the tools to help developers wade through these issues.\"  \nOver the years, the Linux Foundation has also become an events organization. Indeed, Zemlin said, \"One thing I remind people of all the time is just hosting a meeting like this, which is one of the largest drivers of the Linux Foundation's budget.\" \nAlso: Why don't more people use desktop Linux? I have a theory you might not like\nConferences such as KubeCon enable developers to get together to get to know each other and create ever stronger and more useful programs. He concluded: \"We bring together hundreds of thousands of developers every year. This has been a very important source of innovation and career enhancement for developers who see it as critically important.\"  \nThe Linux Foundation's and Zemlin's work isn't done yet. He sees years, even decades, more work ahead to keep open source safe and to empower new generations of developers.   \nI wish him all the luck in the world. I honestly don't know how he does it. Zemlin claims he knows how the Foundation does it -- and this effort can be summed up in three words: Helpful, hopeful, and humble. \n\"You must be genuinely helpful to developers. We're the janitors of open source. The Linux Foundation takes care of all the boring but important stuff necessary to support software development so developers can focus on code. This work includes events, project marketing, project infrastructure, finances for projects, training and education, legal assistance, standards, facilitation, open source evangelism, and much, much more.\"  \nAlso: Red Hat's new OpenShift delivers AI, edge and security enhancements\nHe continued: \"The hopeful part is really the optimistic part. When in 2007, people were saying that this would never work. When leaders of huge companies tell everyone that you know all that you're doing is a cancer or terrible, you have to have a sense of optimism that there are better days ahead. You have to always be thinking, 'No, we can do it and stick with it.'\"  \nHowever, Zemlin concluded that the number one trait that's \"important in working in open source is this idea of humility. I work with hundreds of people every day, and none of them work at the Linux Foundation. We must lead through influence, and that really has been the secret for 20 years of working here without going totally insane. If you can check your ego and take criticism, open source actually turns out to be a really fun community to work with.\"  \nIn a world where humble leadership is seen as an oxymoron, I'm glad we have a Jim Zemlin who can check his ego. We need more leaders like him.\n",

    "content": "The Linux kernel is at the heart of countless operating systems, powering everything from smartphones to servers. At the center of its development for decades has been Linus Torvalds, a name synonymous with the project itself. But what would happen to the Linux kernel if Linus Torvalds were to suddenly pass away?\nFirst, it’s crucial to recognize that while Torvalds is the most prominent figure in Linux development, the kernel itself is the product of a vast, global community of developers and maintainers. Over the years, Torvalds has overseen the direction and quality of the kernel, ensuring the code adheres to stringent standards and that the development process runs smoothly. However, he is not the only contributor by any stretch. Thousands of developers worldwide contribute code, bug fixes, and improvements to the project.\nThe Linux kernel development community is structured in a way that allows it to function without a single point of failure. While Torvalds plays a key role, he has delegated authority over different subsystems to trusted lieutenants. These individuals oversee specific areas of the kernel, making decisions and maintaining high standards in their respective domains. This hierarchy ensures that even without Torvalds, the project would continue under the stewardship of these maintainers.\nIn the event of Torvalds’ death, the leadership of the Linux kernel would likely transition to one or more of these senior maintainers. The Linux Foundation, an organization that supports and promotes the project, could play a role in coordinating this transition. The development would move forward with little interruption because of the established processes, well-maintained code, and the kernel’s open-source nature.\nThe community surrounding Linux is known for its collaborative spirit, which means discussions and decisions about the future direction of the kernel would involve key maintainers and contributors. While there might be a period of adjustment, the kernel’s development pace would likely remain steady. Over the years, Torvalds himself has taken breaks, with others stepping up to manage kernel releases in his absence -- a sign that the development model is already designed to accommodate leadership changes.\nLong-term, the Linux kernel might evolve to reflect new leadership styles and priorities. While Torvalds’ unique blend of expertise and blunt communication has shaped the kernel’s culture, his absence could lead to a shift in tone or processes. That said, the fundamental principles of open-source development, peer review, and a meritocratic approach would remain intact, ensuring the kernel continues to thrive.\nAnd so, while Linus Torvalds’ contribution to the Linux kernel is immeasurable, the project is built to survive without him. The established network of maintainers, combined with the global developer community, would keep the kernel’s development on track. The death of Torvalds would certainly be a somber moment for the tech world, but it wouldn’t spell the end for Linux -- instead, it would mark the beginning of a new chapter in its development.\n© 1998-2024 BetaNews, Inc.

А тут вдруг доб­роволь­ный труд нес­коль­ких раз­работ­чиков отверга­ют вро­де бы за одну толь­ко наци­ональ­ность.\nТем, кто мало зна­ком с миром опен­сорса, важ­но объ­яснить вто­рой клю­чевой момент. Сло­ва «доб­роволь­ный труд» вов­се не обя­затель­но зна­чат, что раз­работ­чик пилит ядро Linux у себя дома и пита­ется чем бог пош­лет. Боль­шинс­тво мей­нтей­неров, вклю­чая самого Тор­валь­дса, впол­не офи­циаль­но получа­ют воз­награж­дение.\nЧа­ще все­го линук­соиды‑ядер­щики работа­ют в какой‑нибудь ком­пании, которая сама нуж­дает­ся в низ­коуров­невом коде для Linux и потому дер­жит на зар­пла­те соот­ветс­тву­ющих девело­перов. Они тру­дят­ся в основном на свою кон­тору, но заод­но что‑то ком­митят в апс­трим — то есть отправ­ляют пат­чи на ревью Тор­валь­дсу и его помощ­никам, а те реша­ют, вклю­чать или не вклю­чать новый код в ядро.\nКруп­ные ком­пании вро­де Red Hat, Intel или IBM еще и донатят спе­циаль­ным НКО (нап­ример, Linux Foundation, где работа­ет Линус), а те раз­дают гран­ты авто­рам важ­ных ком­понен­тов, не получа­ющим за свой вклад обыч­ную зар­пла­ту.\nА где круп­ные ком­пании или спон­сиру­емые ими фон­ды, там и про­тив­ное сво­бодо­люби­вому духу сло­веч­ко «ком­пла­енс», то есть тре­бова­ния, которым нуж­но соот­ветс­тво­вать. Нап­ример, соб­людать сан­кции, если их вве­ло пра­витель­ство стра­ны, в которой работа­ет ком­пания или фонд.\nКак минимум часть рос­сий­ских прог­раммис­тов, исклю­чен­ных из MAINTAINERS, тру­доус­тро­ены в под­сан­кци­онных фир­мах: «Сбе­ре», «Бай­кал элек­тро­никс» и «Откры­той мобиль­ной плат­форме», при­над­лежащей «Рос­телеко­му». Сот­рудни­чес­тво с ними, пусть и опос­редован­ное, юрис­ты Red Hat и IBM навер­няка видят как потен­циаль­ную проб­лему. Да и самому Linux Foundation за несоб­людение сан­кций может при­лететь от федераль­ного пра­витель­ства.\nТак что перед Тор­валь­дсом, ско­рее все­го, встал выбор меж­ду один­надцатью раз­работ­чиками (из более чем тысячи) и круп­ными донора­ми. Потеря чего из это­го нав­редит раз­витию Linux боль­ше? Ответ оче­виден.\nИн­терес­но, что нап­рямую об этом ска­зано не было (нес­мотря на прось­бы выражать­ся яснее): Тор­валь­дс лишь сос­лался на нежела­ние обсуждать с широкой пуб­ликой «юри­дичес­кие детали». Но намеки сов­сем не тон­кие.\nТут кто‑то обя­затель­но ска­жет, что при­нятие полити­чес­ких сто­рон нав­редит обще­му делу еще боль­ше и луч­ше бы потерять день­ги спон­соров, но не нарушить прин­ципы. Но для тех, кто хорошо зна­ком с твор­чес­твом Тор­валь­дса, его нежела­ние воп­реки все­му сто­ять горой за иде­алы сво­бод­ного соф­та вряд ли будет шоком.\nТор­валь­дс никог­да не стре­мил­ся выражать­ся и дей­ство­вать ней­траль­но. Есть це­лые кол­лекции при­меров того, как «отец Linux» кому‑то гру­бит или откро­вен­но посыла­ет. Он неод­нократ­но ссо­рил­ся с дру­гими раз­работ­чиками и был цен­тром самых раз­ных скан­далов.\nА вот каким‑то мощ­ным иде­оло­гом сво­бод­ного соф­та Тор­валь­дс никог­да не был. Лицен­зировать ядро Linux по GPL его изна­чаль­но уго­ворил Ричард Стол­лман, и Тор­валь­дс, в отли­чие от него, прак­тику­ет куда более ути­литар­ный под­ход к опен­сорсу.\nДля Стол­лма­на и его сорат­ников из FSF сво­бода соф­та — это цель, а ядро Linux — прос­то ком­понент, без которо­го сис­тема GNU/Linux не смог­ла бы работать. Для Тор­валь­дса же все наобо­рот: раз­работ­ка Linux — цель, а сво­бод­ная лицен­зия — средс­тво ее дос­тижения.\nОт­сюда и час­тые раз­ногла­сия. Нап­ример, Тор­валь­дс не раз кри­тико­вал GPL v3 — новую вер­сию лицен­зии, которая обя­зыва­ет раз­работ­чиков железа рас­кры­вать код про­шив­ки, если в ней исполь­зован опен­сор­сный код. По мне­нию Тор­валь­дса, такой радика­лизм лишь умень­шит популяр­ность Linux, а потому не нужен.\nНу и наконец, если кто‑то счи­тал, что раз­работ­ка сво­бод­ного соф­та — это какой‑то отдель­ный мир без полити­ки, то зря. Прос­то полити­чес­кими в нем обыч­но счи­тают­ся сов­сем дру­гие темы: нап­ример, какой про­токол или стан­дарт выб­рать. Отве­ты на такие воп­росы — вещь вов­се не абс­трак­тная, и они могут нап­рямую помочь или нав­редить какой‑нибудь круп­ной ком­пании, а зна­чит, на кону неред­ко боль­шие день­ги.\nКа­кие выводы мож­но сде­лать из этой исто­рии? Пер­вый и самый оче­вид­ный свя­зан с лич­ностью Линуса Тор­валь­дса. Судить о его манере руководс­тва, сти­ле пуб­лично­го обще­ния и взгля­дах на опен­сорс я, пожалуй, оставляю читате­лю. Посове­тую толь­ко не при­писы­вать челове­ку при­вер­женность опре­делен­ным (или, самое веселое, — не впол­не опре­делен­ным) иде­алам, а затем гне­вать­ся, что он им не соот­ветс­тву­ет.\nДля меня куда важ­нее вто­рой, гло­баль­ный вывод. Чем более серь­езную роль в нашей жиз­ни игра­ет софт, тем слож­нее будет его раз­работ­ке оста­вать­ся в сто­роне от мир­ских дел. Исто­рия с ядром Linux и рус­ски­ми мей­нтей­нерами — яркий тому при­мер. И совер­шенно точ­но не пос­ледний.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tГлавный редактор\t\t\t\nБез малого три года назад я рассказывал, как съезжал с Google и пробовал другие способы ис…\nТолько важные новости и лучшие статьи\n\n        Подписаться\n      \n",

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until they close on January 7 at 11:59 pm PT. Programming and funding will begin in early 2025.\nToday, we’re announcing the call for applicants for the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund, a program designed to financially and programmatically improve security and sustainability of open source projects.  Applications are open on a rolling basis until they close on January 7 at 11:59 PM PT.\nWe’re launching with $1.25 million to be invested across 125 projects, backed through the kind support of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, American Express, Chainguard, HeroDevs, Kraken, Mayfield Fund, Microsoft,  1Password, Shopify, Stripe, Superbloom, Vercel, Zerodha, and others. Beyond today’s launch, we will continue to accept partners in joining our mission towards funding open source security. And apart from pure financial support, the three-week program will provide maintainers with security education, mentorship, tooling, certification, and more. For a full explanation of program eligibility and benefits, see below.\nFor the people that maintain much of the open source that the world depends on today, security is important but also often difficult to prioritize amongst all the other work needed when running a popular open source project. Even more, while new research shows organizations invest billions of dollars into open source, cybersecurity audits are not a point of emphasis from organizations. Nobody wants their open source project to be the source of security issues to people who use it, but keeping up to date with everything, dealing with security reports and issuing fixes all takes time. And that is often the hardest thing to find when you are already maintaining the project in your spare time.\nTalking with maintainers, foundations and other companies like ourselves, we wanted to create a different way to help.  For some maintainers, being able to get funding would help them free up the time to focus on security; for others, it’s the learnings, experts, and community that can help. Building on learnings from other open source funders and community-driven security practices, the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund is a first-of-its-kind cohort-based program linked to funding. The goal is to improve security for projects in a way that scales, by building a security-minded community of maintainers and funders with shared objectives. The community stands to benefit with reduced security risk, visibility and insights on project security status, and consistent reporting.\nWe’re taking an ecosystem approach because we believe a dependency graph is more than just connected software. It is the underlying people that underpin the success and sustainability of open source. We’re investing in security because it is critical to the global software ecosystem, and for many organizations it is critical for navigating policies like Secure by Design and the EU Cyber Resilience Act, and for long-term sustainability.\nOpen source helps American Express provide the world’s best customer experience every day by allowing our developers to innovate, collaborate, and share. The security of open source software has long been a priority for our company. We are proud to back this important program that aims to improve security in a scalable way and help support open source maintainers to implement secure software.\nWe are committing to the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund in alignment with our long-standing commitment to the FOSS ecosystem, from which we benefit immensely. We see this program as an exciting win-win: getting money directly into the hands of FOSS developers, while enabling critical security improvements in software that benefits everyone.\nGitHub will provide security education, engagement with experts, community support, promotion, and bi-annual security health reports. Maintainers will get hands-on learning of security principles, tools like GitHub Copilot and Copilot Autofix to help improve security posture, reduce security debt, and improve confidence of downstream users. All funding goes directly to maintainers via GitHub Sponsors. Anyone who is a current maintainer of an open source project with a valid open source license and located in one of the regions supported by GitHub Sponsors can apply.\nIn total, participants will receive:\nGitHub wouldn’t be GitHub without its community of developers, partners, and customers. Already, through GitHub Sponsors, we’ve seen the impact organizations have when they invest in their open source dependencies—whether that’s through  general dependencies support,  bringing new ideas to life or even creating full-time careers.  Since introducing support for organizations through GitHub Sponsors, more than 5,800 organizations, including Microsoft and Stripe, have invested in maintainers and projects on GitHub, up nearly 40% YoY. Cumulatively, the platform has unlocked over $60 million in funding for maintainers to help them spend more time working on their projects.\nBut we know we’re just scratching the surface when it comes to organizations and corporate support of open source. This summer, we partnered with the Linux Foundation and researchers from Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH) to learn more about the state of open source funding today. Diving in, we assessed organizations funding behaviors, potential misalignments, and opportunities to improve. In the report launched today, we found:\nWe all stand to benefit from unlocking more funding for open source. By tackling problems like open source security as an ecosystem, we believe we can help create more available funding and resources that are vital to the sustainability of open source. Not every open source project or maintainer has access to funding and training for security. That’s why we created a fund that everyone potentially eligible can apply for. For some, receiving training, tools, mentorship, and financial support can be a game changer, allowing them to invest time in improving their project’s security. We are encouraged by the work of other organizations, projects, and communities shaping the ecosystem. Moreover, ecosystem partners like CURIOUSS, Ecosyste.ms, Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard, Mozilla Foundation, OpenForum Europe, OpenJS, OpenSSF, Open Source Initiative, Open Technology Fund, Open Source Collective, Sovereign Tech Agency, and Sustain OSS, and others engaged and helped provide input, feedback, and ideas as we have brought this idea to life.\nWe are excited that the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund will apply learnings from our OpenSSF community by directly engaging with critical projects and developers to help improve the security posture of their software and communities. We’ve long understood that people are the engine that powers open source, and excited that this model builds on the research collaboration between GitHub, Harvard University, and the Linux Foundation and the OpenSSF community. We look forward to the positive impact on open source sustainability and security.\nThis is the beginning of a journey into helping find ways to secure open source. On its own, it’s not the answer, but we are confident it will help. We will be monitoring the impact of these investments and share what we learn as we go.\nJoin us in investing and building a safer, more secure open source ecosystem. Our hope is that new programs like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund empower a healthier, more diverse and more secure open source ecosystem for all by encouraging a culture of proactive security and also helping organizations show the value to their stakeholders in investing in open source security. If you are providing financial investment, promoting secure open source practices, sharing your expertise, or advocating for secure practices, we can all help build a stronger, more resilient open source community—together.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t@martinwoodward\n\t\t\t\t\nVP of Developer Relations\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the stars of the Open Source Zone at GitHub Universe 2024 🔎\nThe GitHub Foundations Certification exam fee is now waived for all students verified through GitHub Education.\nMicrosoft and GitHub are committed to empowering developers around the world to innovate, collaborate, and create solutions that’ll shape the next generation of technology. \nFindings in our latest study show that the quality of code written with GitHub Copilot is significantly more functional, readable, reliable, maintainable, and concise. \nEverything you need to master GitHub, all in one place.\nBuild what’s next on GitHub, the place for anyone from anywhere to build anything.\nMeet the companies and engineering teams that build with GitHub.\nGet tickets to the 10th anniversary of our global developer event on AI, DevEx, and security.\nDiscover tips, technical guides, and best practices in our biweekly newsletter just for devs.\n",

Many of us stick with Microsoft’s OS because it’s what we know, not because it’s the best option out there, but imagine an operating system that prioritizes speed, simplicity, and style, all while keeping your workflow seamless and frustration-free.\nEnter Nitrux -- a sleek, modern Linux OS designed to offer exactly that. Unlike Windows, Nitrux keeps things light and nimble by being built on a minimalist foundation that ditches unnecessary extras. Its NX Desktop provides a fresh, visually polished interface that feels intuitive and responsive, ideal for anyone seeking a fast, adaptable, and aesthetically pleasing computing experience without the sluggish updates and system bloat Windows users know all too well.\nSEE ALSO:\nNitrux 3.7.1 has just been released, bringing an updated Linux 6.11.5-1 system focused on performance, security, and compatibility. If you’re interested in trying out Nitrux, starting with a fresh install is best for full compatibility but existing users can easily upgrade to the new version.\nThis release includes the latest software updates like Firefox 132.0, MESA 24.2.4 for graphics, and the latest Nvidia and AMD drivers. It also offers support for new hardware, including Qualcomm’s Wi-Fi 6 and Intel graphics, providing better performance across devices.\nNitrux 3.7.1 is packed with performance tweaks to improve speed and efficiency, particularly for gamers and developers. Enhanced network settings boost connection speeds, and memory adjustments help the system run smoother. On the visual side, the display manager (SDDM) has been revamped for a sleeker experience, with experimental support for Wayland -- although Nvidia users may experience gaming compatibility issues, so be warned.\nGamers will appreciate new GameMode support, which automatically optimizes settings for better performance. Extended display support has also been improved with EVDI and DisplayLink drivers. Security has been upgraded too, with added protections against network attacks, and system optimizations keep essential tasks running efficiently.\nFor KDE users, the new KZones feature lets you snap windows into custom zones, a bit like the window-snapping feature in Windows. Developers will also notice a more streamlined code-editing experience, with soft word wrapping now on by default in the micro editor.\nDownload Nitrux 3.7.1 here.

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        2022 reichten drei Patentlizensierer Dutzende Klagen vor einem US-Bundesgericht ein und beschuldigten Firmen der Rechtsverletzung. Das rächt sich diesmal.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Feng Yu/Shutterstock.com)\n    \nPatent-Trolle gelten Kritikern als eine Art Pest. Sie kaufen oder erben in der Regel gewerbliche Schutzansprüche für mehr oder weniger ausschlaggebende \"Erfindungen\", die sie selbst nicht getätigt haben. Damit mahnen sie kleine und große Unternehmen ab, verlangen Unterlassung und meist auch hohen Schadenersatz. Die Strategie geht oft auf, wenn den Betroffenen ein Gang vor Gericht zu umständlich und teuer erscheint. Die reinen Rechteinhaber missbrauchen damit gezielt Schwächen des Patentsystems und untergraben dieses so Stück für Stück.\n\n          Was fehlt: In der rapiden Technikwelt häufig die Zeit, die vielen News und Hintergründe neu zu sortieren. Am Wochenende wollen wir sie uns nehmen, die Seitenwege abseits des Aktuellen verfolgen, andere Blickwinkel probieren und Zwischentöne hörbar machen. \n        \nNeben Deutschland gelten die USA als besonders lukrativ für Patent-Trolle. 96 Prozent aller Patentverletzungsverfahren in den Vereinigten Staaten stammten von klagefreudigen Verwertungsfirmen, die Betroffene mit ihrem Gebaren \"belästigten\", fand die Federal Trade Commission (FTC) bereits 2016 heraus. Die US-Handelsaufsicht drängte daher schon damals auf Reformen. Der Schwerpunkt der bei juristischen Streitigkeiten ins Feld geführten gewerblichen Schutzrechte war laut der Studie zu 88 Prozent der Sektor der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien. Bei über 75 Prozent davon handelte es sich um Softwarepatente. Eine einheitliche Front gegen Inhaber oft fragwürdiger Patente, die keine eigenen Produkte herstellen und damit nur Geld eintreiben wollen, gibt es in den USA dennoch nicht.\nDie Auswüchse des Phänomens macht aktuell ein Fall deutlich, den die US-Bürgerrechtsorganisation Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) ins Rampenlicht gerückt hat. 2022 reichten demnach drei Unternehmen mit seltsamen Namen und keinem klaren Geschäftszweck außer Patentstreitigkeiten Dutzende von Klagen vor dem US-Bundesgericht von Delaware ein. Sie warfen Unternehmen aller Größenordnungen wie Reddit, Bloomberg, Tastemade und Skillshare Patentverletzungen vor. Einige dieser Klagen beruhten auf Patentansprüchen für grundlegende Aspekte des modernen Lebens. Darunter war etwa ein gewerbliches Schutzrecht, das sich auf den Prozess der Arbeitszeiterfassung über eine App bezieht.\nDie klagenden Firmen – Mellaconic IP, Backertop Licensing und Nimitz Technologies – legten es offenbar darauf an, die Patente auf Kosten Dritter zu versilbern. Die von ihnen eingereichten Fälle nahmen aber bald eine ungewöhnliche Wendung, die an sich die Regel sein sollte. Der Vorsitzende Bundesrichter von Delaware, Colm Connolly, nahm nämlich eigentlich nur seine justiziellen Prüfaufgaben wahr und verlangte weitere Informationen über die Patente und deren Eigentumsverhältnisse.\nDamit löste Connolly eine Lawine an Erkenntnissen und Gegenmaßnahmen aus. Einer der mutmaßlichen Patentinhaber sei just ein völlig fachfremder Imbisswagenbetreiber namens Hau Bui, berichtet die EFF. Ihm sei \"passives Einkommen\" – also leicht verdientes Geld – versprochen worden. Er habe aber nur Anspruch auf einen kleinen Teil der durch die Klagen erzielten Einnahmen gehabt. Als eine weitere Eigentümerin maßgeblicher Schutzrechte habe sich die Ehefrau eines Anwalts bei IP Edge herausgestellt. Das ist die mit allen drei Klägern verbandelte, auf die Verwertung von Immaterialgüterrechten spezialisierte Kanzlei. Zu dieser gehört zudem der Ableger Mavexar.\nNach einer umfassenden Untersuchung stellte Connolly zunächst fest, dass es sich bei den klagenden Organisationen um Briefkastenfirmen handelte. Den mit ihnen verbundenen Anwälten warf er vor, gegen die Berufsethik verstoßen zu haben. Der Richter wies darauf hin, dass sie den Fast-Food-Verkäufer Bui möglicherweise über seine potenzielle persönliche Haftung in dem Fall in die Irre geführt hatten.\nConnolly kam ferner zum Schluss, dass IP Edge der \"faktische Eigentümer\" der vor Gericht geltend gemachten Patente sei, jedoch \"große Anstrengungen unternommen\" habe, um seine Beteiligung zu verschleiern. Er konstatierte: IP Edge habe die Übertragung der Patente an die Briefkastenfirmen veranlasst, die die Kanzlei \"unter den Namen relativ unerfahrener Personen gegründet hatte\". Diese seien von der Büroleiterin der Anwaltsfirma, Linh Deitz, angeworben worden. Der Richter meldete zudem drei Advokaten von IP Edge an das Komitee für unerlaubte Anwaltspraxis des Obersten Gerichtshofs von Texas, weil sie in dem Bundesstaat \"unerlaubte Anwaltstätigkeiten\" betrieben hätten. Er zeigte die Zuständigen auch beim US-Justizministerium an und verlangte eine Untersuchung von Personen, die mit IP Edge und Maxevar in Verbindung stehen.\nDie EFF spricht von einem \"wilden Patent-Troll-System\". Die beteiligten Anwälte hätten Connollys Befugnis zur Fortsetzung seiner Recherchen infrage gestellt. Da Transparenz in Bundesgerichten unerlässlich sei und für alle Parteien gelte, reichten die Aktivisten zusammen mit zwei anderen Zusammenschlüssen von Patentrechtsreformern eine Stellungnahme zur Unterstützung des Richters ein. Demnach hat \"die Öffentlichkeit ein Recht – und ein Bedürfnis –zu wissen, wer die Verfahren in öffentlich finanzierten Gerichten kontrolliert und davon profitiert\". Auch Unternehmen, die bereits Opfer von Patent-Trollen wurden, sowie die Handelskammer intervenierten mit vergleichbaren Eingaben.\nDas Berufungsgericht bestätigte daraufhin im Juli Connollys Befugnis, den Fall genauer unter die Lupe zu nehmen. Das führte dazu, dass die beteiligten Anwälte an den Disziplinarrat ihrer jeweiligen beruflichen Kammern verwiesen wurden. Eines der Lizenzierungsunternehmen und sein mutmaßlicher Eigentümer starteten trotz dieser klaren Ansage einen letzten Versuch, den Fall zu ihren Gunsten zu wenden. Im Juli entschied das für Patentfragen zuständige Berufungsgericht für den Regierungsbezirk Washington aber, dass die Untersuchung von Backertop Licensing und die Anordnung einer Zeugenaussage des mutmaßlichen Eigentümers \"ein geeignetes Mittel zur Untersuchung eines möglichen Fehlverhaltens\" sei.\nNach Ansicht der EFF sollten derartige justizielle Prüfungen in der undurchsichtigen Welt der Patent-Trolle Pflicht sein. Vor Gericht seien haarsträubende Details zutage getreten. So habe etwa Nimitz ein einziges US-Patent – das mit der Nummer 7.848.328 gegen elf Firmen geltend gemacht. Als Connolly den angeblichen Inhaber des Lizenzierungsunternehmens aufforderte, vor Gericht auszusagen, konnte dieser nichts über den Inhalt oder den Erwerb des gewerblichen Rechtanspruchs sagen. Er kannte nicht einmal den Namen des Patents (\"Broadcast Content Encapsulation\"). Auf die Frage, welche Technologie dadurch abgedeckt sei, räumte er ein: \"Ich habe es nicht ausreichend geprüft, um das zu wissen\". Bei der Übernahme des Anspruchs sei jedenfalls \"kein Geld geflossen\".\nDas Nimitz-Breitband-Patent stammte ursprünglich vom finnischen Mobilfunkausrüster Nokia, der dieses und mehrere andere ähnliche Schutzrechte 2013 an France Brevets, einen französischen staatlichen Investmentfonds, abtrat. Dieser wiederum übertrug den Anspruch 2021 an ein US-Unternehmen namens Burley Licensing, das mit IP Edge verknüpft ist. Foodtruck-Besitzer Bui hat diesen Vertrag im Namen von Burley unterzeichnet.\nFrance Brevets wurde 2009 mit 100 Millionen Euro Startkapital der französischen Regierung gegründet, um Immaterialgüterrechte zu verwalten. Der Fonds sollte 35 Prozent aller Einnahmen im Zusammenhang mit der \"Monetarisierung und Durchsetzung\" der Patentansprüche in diesem Fall erhalten. Burley wiederum verpflichtete sich, innerhalb eines Jahres mindestens eine Patentverletzungsklage einzureichen und innerhalb von 24 Monaten einen \"Gesamtbruttoumsatz von mindestens 100.000 US-Dollar\" zu erzielen. Andernfalls sollten die Patentrechte an France Brevets zurückfallen.\nBurley gründete daraufhin Nimitz – ein Unternehmen ohne Vermögenswerte außer dem einen Patent. Die Lizenzierungsfirma erhielt dafür eine Postanschrift von einer Filiale des Büroausrüsters Staples im texanischen Frisco und übertrug den gewerblichen Rechtsanspruch im August 2021 der Tochterfirma, während die Verpflichtungen gegenüber France Brevets bis zur Schließung des Fonds im Jahr 2022 unverändert blieben.\nEs sei beunruhigend, dass Patentklagen oft von Unternehmen finanziert werden, die kein echtes Interesse an Innovationen haben, betont die EFF. Noch besorgniserregender sei es, wenn von ausländischen Regierungen unterstützte Organisationen, wie France Brevets, das US-Patentsystem aus Profitgründen manipulierten.\nÜber den Verlauf der Verweisungen Connollys an die Aufsichtsgremien ist noch nichts bekannt. Weder das Justizministerium noch die verschiedenen Anwaltskammern der Bundesstaaten sprechen im Allgemeinen öffentlich über laufende Ermittlungen, erklärte Joe Mullin von der EFF gegenüber heise online. \"Wir werden also die Ergebnisse der Ermittlungen nicht erfahren, es sei denn, sie veröffentlichen Anklagen oder andere Resultate.\"\nJedes Jahr werden in den USA Hunderte von Patentklagen wegen alltäglicher Internetaktivitäten eingereicht. Sie drehen sich etwa um das Ansehen von Online-Werbung, das Anzeigen von Bildmenüs, das Teilen von Fitnessdaten oder den Verkauf über spezielle Warenverzeichnisse oder von Bio-Produkten.\nDabei hat der Supreme Court mit den Grundsatzurteilen Alice vs. CLS Bank und \"Mayo vs. Prometheus die Latte für Softwarepatente bereits deutlich höher gehängt. Methoden, die für ihre Anwendbarkeit lediglich eines Computers bedürfen, reichen demnach nicht aus, um eine abstrakte Idee zu einer patentwürdigen Erfindung zu machen. Der Allerweltsansatz \"machen wir es mit einem Computer\" soll bei einem Patentantrag also nicht zum Erfolg führen.\nDoch es gibt immer wieder Versuche, die höchstgerichtlichen Entscheidungen zu umgehen oder außer Kraft zu setzen. 2019 etwa veröffentlichte der damalige, von Donald Trump eingesetzte Direktor des US-Patentamts, Andrei Iancu, Entwürfe für neue Leitlinien für die internen Prüfer, mit denen gewerbliche Schutzrechte für \"computerimplementierte Erfindungen\" wieder salonfähig werden sollten. Zuletzt sorgten zwei Gesetzesentwürfe im US-Kongress für Schlagzeilen, die das Rad ebenfalls zurückdrehen würden.\nEiner davon ist der Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA), der in verschiedenen, interfraktionell eingebrachten Versionen im Senat und im Repräsentantenhaus anhängig ist. Er würde wesentliche Beschränkungen für Patente im Bereich Computertechnologie aus dem Alice-Urteil aufheben. Einer der Initiatoren, der Abgeordnete Kevin Kiley von den Republikanern, begründete das Vorhaben damit, dass die USA derzeit aufgrund \"verwirrender Urteile des Obersten Gerichtshofs\" ein besonders restriktives Patentsystem hätten. PERA würde eine größere Vielfalt von Erfindungen abdecken, \"die ausländische Nationen wie China von ihren Erfindern bereits patentieren lassen\".\nJoseph Heino, Patentanwalt in der Kanzlei Amundsen Davis, hält davon nichts: Inkonsistente Fallentscheidungen waren ihm zufolge einer der Gründe, warum 1982 das Berufungsgericht in Washington gegründet worden sei. Die Gesetzgeber schlügen vor, das Erfordernis der Neuheit zu streichen und nur noch das der Nützlichkeit zu belassen. Die Innovationskraft einer Erfindung müsste dann höchstens noch nach einer weiteren Klausel des Patentgesetzes geprüft werden.\nWenn dies dazu dienen solle, Erfindern in den USA die Patentierung einer größeren Vielfalt von Erfindungen zu ermöglichen, werde PERA scheitern, gibt Heino zu bedenken. Der Vorschlag erweitere aber die Basis für Angriffe auf die Patentierbarkeit. PERA könnte effektive Schutzmaßnahmen schwächen – insbesondere angesichts neuer, sich schnell entwickelnder Technologien. Die EFF kritisiert ferner, der Entwurf würde auch die Patentierung menschlicher Gene ausweiten – obwohl der Supreme Court auch dies 2013 im Wesentlichen blockiert habe.\nBei der zweiten umstrittenen Gesetzesinitiative handelt es sich um den Prevail Act. Damit soll der Zugang zu einem erneuten Überprüfungsverfahren für bereits gewährte Schutzansprüche auf Personen und Unternehmen beschränkt werden, die direkt wegen eines Patents bedroht oder verklagt wurden. Die EFF und andere gemeinnützige sowie mitgliedschaftsbasierte Organisationen wie Unified Patents oder die Linux Foundation dürften sich nicht mehr einbringen, obwohl sie über diesen Weg unter anderem 2013 bereits ein \"Podcasting-Patent\" zu Fall brachten. Mit dem Gesetz würden auch andere Änderungen am Patentanfechtungsverfahren erfolgen, die fast ausschließlich Trollen und einigen wenigen großen Rechteinhabern zugute kämen.\nPERA und der Prevail Act sollten eigentlich Mitte November vom Rechtsausschuss des Senats gebilligt und im Anschluss im Plenum verabschiedet werden. In letzter Minute wurden sie aber von der Tagesordnung genommen. Wie es unter Trump weitergeht, steht in den Sternen. Dessen enger Berater Elon Musk zeigte sich bisher vielfach davon überzeugt, dass Patente lediglich dazu dienten, \"den Fortschritt zu unterdrücken\".\nDer Unternehmer selbst hat nur ein paar Dutzend solcher gewerblichen Schutzrechte beantragt, um die darin enthaltenen Innovationen auf gesichertem Weg publik zu machen. Generell seien Patente \"etwas für Schwache\", meinte Musk einst. Auf X gehen sogar Gerüchte um, dass er das US-Patentamt mit seiner Entbürokratisierungsinstitution Doge abschaffen könnte.\nHierzulande beschloss der Bundestag 2021 einen Gesetzentwurf zur Vereinfachung und Modernisierung des Patentrechts. Dessen Ziel ist es, das scharfe Schwert des patentrechtlichen Unterlassungsanspruchs aus Gründen der Verhältnismäßigkeit etwas einzuschränken und Trollen so zu erschweren. Nach dem Urteil des Bundesgerichtshofs (BGH) im Fall Wärmetauscher von 2016 gilt zwar prinzipiell schon, dass eine gerichtliche Verfügung nicht ergehen darf, wenn sie eine \"unverhältnismäßige Härte\" darstellen würde. Der Gesetzgeber wollte nun dafür sorgen, dass dieses bislang selten genutzte Korrektiv mit der Option zu Verhältnismäßigkeitserwägungen auch in der gerichtlichen Praxis besser zum Tragen kommt. Über die Auswirkungen der Änderung ist noch wenig bekannt. Sie dürften sich in Grenzen halten.\nEine weitere Unbekannte ist das neue, Mitte 2023 gestartete Europäische Einheitspatent. Der Förderverein für eine freie informationelle Infrastruktur (FFII) warnt seit Langem, dass vor allem große US-Konzerne und andere Patent-Trolle künftig über die damit verknüpfte spezielle Gerichtsbarkeit mittelständische Firmen ohne großes Portfolio an gewerblichen Schutzrechten in der EU in Grund und Boden klagen könnten. Besonders die auch in Europa umkämpften Softwarepatente wären ihm zufolge durch die vereinheitlichte Rechtsprechung leichter durchsetzbar.\n\n\n\n(mki)\n\n\n\n    Keine News verpassen!

    "content": "Have you ever known someone whose technical brilliance was overshadowed by personal failings? This is the story of Hans Reiser, a software developer driven to create a superior Linux filesystem, but whose difficult personality got in the way.\nThen came the disappearance of his wife, Nina, in 2006. The investigation pointed to Reiser, ending with a murder conviction that shocked the tech world.\nReiser’s story is a reminder of how technical skills and personal integrity need to go hand in hand. From prison, he reflects on his mistakes, realizing the need for empathy and collaboration. His legacy, once about innovation, now serves as a cautionary tale.\nWelcome to CoRecursive, I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Today’s episode is the story of a piece of software being built.\nMy wife and I often debate people’s character. Sometimes it’s big, like separating Michael Jackson’s music from his actions. Is “Billie Jean” still great, or is it tainted? But usually, it’s more specific. Sometimes people give her bad vibes. And I’m not always a good judge of character, I give people the benefit of the doubt, where she often knows right away what she thinks about someone. And she’ll know that the person is off. She’s not always right, but I mean, she’s not going to listen to this so like, yeah, like actually, shes always right, it just takes me time to realize it usually.\nBut anyways, this is going somewhere I swear. So, it’s late January 2024. I’m at my desk, clicking through links, and I land on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, the LKML. It’s mostly patches. One title reads “Merge tag timers-v6,” followed by a message: “Happy New Year 2024! Please consider pulling these changes.” Then comes the literal diff patch: + code on line X, - this code. You can apply these patches to your source with git apply, just like pulling a pull request.\nBut that’s not the link I get. The one I follow starts like this:\nHans:\nI was asked by a kind Fredrick Brennan for my comments that I might offer on the discussion of removing ReiserFS V3 from the kernel. I don’t post directly because I am in prison for killing my wife Nina in 2006.\nHans:\nI am very sorry for my crime–a proper apology would be off topic for this forum, but available to any who ask.\nThat’s Hans Reiser. His voice, like everyone else’s here except mine, is generated by OpenAI.\nThe letter responds to a prompt from Fredrick Brennan. ReiserFS is being deprecated from the kernel, meaning it’s becoming obsolete and will be removed entirely.\nAnd Hans Reiser, the creator—well, he’s in prison. For murder. And actually the file system and the man and the murder are all really bound up together. They are all linked and so the letter goes on. He points people to Reiser4. A more maintainable basis for the future of file system, he calls it.\nAnd then he goes on. And on. Thousands of words. About the technical challenges, the interpersonal conflicts, the mistakes he made. The dreams he had. The life he lost.\nIt’s this unexpected thing. A letter from a convicted murderer on a technical mailing list. A glimpse into the human story behind the code. A man trying to explain himself, to grapple with his past. A man wondering if redemption is even possible. And it all starts with just trying to make a better linux filesystem.\nThere are many ways to tell the story of ReiserFS, Hans, and Nina, his victim. Entire books cover it. But my way of telling the story… well I want to tell you about how you can’t separate the person from the code. You can’t separate the technical from the social. You can’t be a monster in one domain and not have it be part of the others. It’s all mixed up together. That’s today’s story\nSo, picture this. It’s the late 1990s. The internet is taking off. Linux, this free, open-source operating system, it’s gaining traction. Programmers, they’re building all sorts of new things.  Websites, applications, tools.  And all these things, especially on linux, they’re made of files. Lots and lots of files.\nAnd how does Linux keep track of all these files?  With a filesystem of course.\nAnd back then, the popular Linux filesystem, it was ext2.  It was…okay.  It worked.  But it had its problems.\nUnder the covers, a file system, the code, is like a librarian for your disk. I want to add a new book to the collection, Librarian has to find an empty shelf and put it there. But then it has to update the card catalog with details on where it put the book, or I’ll never find it. This card catalog is your directory listing, the index of the things on your drive.\nImagine you’re doing this, and suddenly the lights go out. Power failure. When they come back on, what’s the state of your library? You might have found the shelf space but never got the book there. Or the book’s on the shelf but not in the catalog. Maybe you’re halfway through writing the catalog card. Everything’s in this weird, half-finished state. Back then, computers crashed all the time, leaving you with a mess. Files marked as stored but not actually there. Files there but not properly recorded. It was chaos.\nSo, if your computer crashed, you had to run this thing called fsck.  Filesystem check.  And it could take hours.  Literally hours.  On a big disk, it could take all day.\nAnd then there were the performance issues.  Big directories, lots of little files?  Ext2 would slow to a crawl.  It used linked lists to organize directories, and if you’ve done your leetcoding exercises, you know that going node by node through a linked list can take time.\nBut yeah, this is 1993, and the dot com boom, which started with the netscape IPO, is still a couple years away. And Hans is in Oakland, California, across the bay. In a cluttered home office, filled with computer monitors, stacks of books, and the hum of cooling fans.\nAnd He wants to build a better filesystem. Faster, more efficient, more elegant than anything out there. But building a filesystem, it’s not a one-person job. It takes a team. And Hans, he didn’t have a lot of money. He was bootstrapping this thing, working a day job, pouring every spare minute into his dream. And then he had this idea.\nHe’d read an article about how Russian programmers, incredibly talented programmers, were working for next to nothing after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Hans, he saw an opportunity. He booked a flight to Moscow.\nNow Moscow in 1993. It’s just a couple years after The Soviet Union collapse. Everything’s changing. And here’s this American programmer, this guy with a cowboy hat, walking into a world he doesn’t really understand. He literally wore a cowboy hat in Moscow, to play up his Americaness. He’s trying to build a team, to communicate his vision, to navigate a culture that’s completely different from his own. He’s this American in Moscow, and he’s sticking out. He’s not blending in. He’s making a statement.\nAnd he’s doing it all on a shoestring budget. He’s paying these programmers a fraction of what they’d make in the U.S., but for them, it’s still a significant raise. And Hans, he’s working his butt off to keep the money coming. He’s coding for Synopsys, then Sun Microsystems, taking on any contract gig he can find. He’s even moonlighting at some army research center in New Jersey, flying back and forth across the country, across continents, just to keep this dream alive.\nHe’s pouring all his energy into this project, into this dream of building a better filesystem. And for a while, it seems like it’s working. The team is making progress. The code is coming together. ReiserFS is starting to take shape.\nHe’s traveling back and forth between the US and Russia, checking in on his team, making sure the code is clean, that the algorithms are efficient. He’s pushing them hard, demanding excellence, because he knows that in the cutthroat world of file systems, there’s no room for second best.\nBut there are cracks in the foundation. Cultural differences, communication barriers, the challenges of managing a remote team. These things, they start to wear on Hans. He’s used to getting his way, to being in control. And in Russia, things aren’t so simple.\nFast forward to March 1998. Saint Petersburg. A cafe next to a canal. Hans is meeting a woman. Nina Sharanova. A mail-order bride. And Hans, he’s smitten. Her voice, her smile, her intelligence. She’s a doctor, an OB-GYN. She seems to be everything he’s looking for.\nAnd so, they get married. A quick courtship, a hastily arranged wedding. And soon, Nina is pregnant. Their first child, Rory, is born in September 1999. It seems like a happy ending, a new chapter in Hans’s life. He’s now got a wife and kid and his team in Russia, and him have made great strides with their filesystem.\nIt had journaling - which was an old idea, actually. Before you shelf the book and update the card catalog, you write to a journal that you are going to do so, then you can recover without having to check every entry in the catalog.\nThen it used B+ trees to organize directories, so no slow listing of files. But the biggest trick actually sort of created more space on the disk. And that was a big deal. But also the price of Han’s ambition was starting to become tragically clear.\nBecause if you rewind a bit, if you go back to the late 80s, before ReiserFS, before Namesys, there were these…warning signs. Little and sometimes big social glitches. They weren’t about the technology, not exactly. They were about Hans himself.\nWhen Han’s at UC Berkeley, and he’s part of this student-run group called the Open Computing Facility, the OCF. It’s down in the basement of Evans Hall. Rows of humming computers, with fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. And for Hans and many others it’s a haven. A place to code, to build, to create. And a place dedicated to Open Source and open access.\nThe OCF is volunteer run, and Hans gets very involved. He even manages to secure a huge donation of Apollo workstations. But the OCF, it’s not just about the technology. It’s about the community. It’s about people working together, sharing ideas, building something bigger than themselves. Open source, it thrives on collaboration.\nAnd Hans, he doesn’t really get that. He’s brilliant, yes, but he’s also got this…intense personality. He’s arrogant. He wants control. He doesn’t play well with others.\nThere are stories. Like the time he booted an undergrad off the system for posting a message he disagreed with on usenet. Or the time he physically assaulted a colleague after a disagreement. Or the meeting minutes with headings like, “Hans Complains, the Earth Shakes, etc.” These weren’t just isolated incidents. They were a pattern.\nOne former OCF user put it this way: He acted as if he owned the Open Computer Facility, and that everyone should kowtow to him. Another said, He went out of his way to be mean, petty, arrogant, and small-minded. These are signs. Signs of a person who’s not well integrated. Signs that are often rationalized away when someone is talented.\nBut yeah, Namesys, by the time they got to version 3 of ReiserFS they were really on to something. Linux kernel version 2.4.1 included ReiserFS as an option and all the sudden this code had distribution. And since it was the first linux filesystem with journalling, it was a solid choice.\nBut the thing that really made it popular, was a NameSys / Han’s innovation called tail packing. ( I feel like I’m going to get tired of the library metaphor ) Imagine that our librarian’s shelves are all divided into blocks that are the size of a medium sized hardcover book. We call that a block, and most file systems had 4kb blocks. That is how a hard drive works, and each little area is a block. The librarian, in the card catalog is actually writing down the address of the blocks where the book is stored. And if the book is larger than the block size, the librarian just splits up the book, puts it in as many blocks as it needs. 4kb is actually pretty small, so many books are split across many many blocks. Fragmentation, if you remember running defrag on your home windows machine like I do, fragmentation is when the books that are big and need to be split are split all over the library, so when retrieving them, the librarian has to go all over the place, instead of all being next to each other, block after block. Defrag is putting them back, sequentially next to each other.\nBut tail packing is a different thing then defragging. It’s a technique for dealing with small files. You see when you have all these books that are a bit larger than the block, you get these little tails, instead of storing them next to the rest of the book, you store them all together. You pack all these tails, ends of book together into one block.\nThis effectively gave you more space, and especially if you had lots of small files. Because imagine without tail packing, if you were storing pamplets instead of books, storing one per block, instead of packing a whole bunch into one block is going to waste a lot of space.\nIt was brilliant! Suddenly, you had all this extra space on your hard drive. No file system checks, more space, and it was significantly faster than ext2.\nAnd the Linux community loved it! Companies issues praise:\nPhilipp:\n ReiserFS is the main engine behind our LivingXML database system…With the great help of ReiserFS, we now have one of the best database systems.\nSUSE Linux, a popular distribution, even adopted it as their default filesystem. This meant enterprise usage and professional support. SuSe was putting their reputation behind and on the line for ReiserFS. Hans, he was on top of the world. His dream, it was becoming a reality. His filesystem was changing the Linux landscape. He was a star in the open-source community. He was getting the recognition he craved.\nBut even then, even as ReiserFS was taking off, there were these whispers.  Rumors of data corruption.  Concerns about scalability.  And then there was Hans himself.  His personality, maybe had some bugs as well. Post honeymoon phase the marriage was getting harder.\nBecause while Hans is in Moscow, chasing his technological ambitions, something else is happening back in Oakland.\nBecause Nina came to the US for love, for a better life.\nNina:\n We were madly in love until our first child was born.\nBut things changed. Hans, he was consumed by his work, spending most of his time in Russia. Nina, she was left to navigate a new culture, a new language, a new life, all while raising two young children on her own.\nAnd it wasn’t just the distance. There were conflicting expectations. Hans, he wanted a traditional wife, someone who would put her career aside and focus on the family. Nina, she had her own dreams, her own ambitions. She wanted to be a doctor in the US, to build a life for herself and her children.\nNina:\n Hans did not want me to be a doctor in the U.S. He wanted me to have six children and then I could deal with my career… He believed that Russian women would stay at home and devote themselves to their children… He didn’t want me to study for my exams. I knew that when I married him. We thought we could change each other.\nBut they couldn’t. The tension, the resentment, it grew with each passing day. Nina, she felt isolated, trapped in a marriage that was slowly suffocating her. Meanwhile Hans full of excitement for more ideas he has about improving filesystems. Or maybe he’s just unsatisfied with where ReiserFS 3 stood.\nHans:\n Hierarchy doesn’t scale well for human beings, and hierarchical namespaces scale extremely poorly.\nHe’s already thinking bigger. He’s got this grand vision, this almost utopian idea of how computers should work. He sees the limitations of existing systems, the walls between applications, the data silos. And he wants to tear them down. He wants to build something better, something faster, something more… connected.\nHe gives a talk at Google. He’s passionate, intense. He’s pacing back and forth, explaining his vision.\nHans:\n The file system is the most central namespace of the OS.\nHans:\n I would like to suggest that namespaces in general are like roads and waterways.\nHe’s building on an idea, an analogy to Adam Smith, the economist. Smith saw how roads and waterways connected cities, how they facilitated trade and communication, how they fueled the growth of civilizations. Hans, he sees files the same way. As the infrastructure that connects data, that allows applications to communicate, that powers the digital world.\nAnd he’s convinced that the current infrastructure, it’s not good enough. It’s fragmented, it’s inefficient. Namespaces are a barrier holding back data and holding back progress. He wants to build a unified namespace, a single, interconnected system where all data is accessible, where information flows freely.\nHans:\n To unify the namespaces within the operating system is a bit of a quest for a holy grail… even though we will never succeed in unifying all the namespaces within the operating system, the closer we can get ourselves to it, we’re in a better place than if we don’t get any closer to it.\nHe secures funding from DARPA, the Pentagon’s R\u0026D agency. They want a filesystem for the future, a filesystem that can handle anything.\nHans:\n Reiser4 is not only a file system. It is a software framework for creation, assembly, and customizing file systems.\nHans:\n How well your file system performs is very much determined by how easy it is to make little changes to it, and the more little experiments you make the higher your performance is going to be.\nIt’s a bit hard for me to understand his vision. But I think its a bit like replaces a file based system with a database, where files can easily be searched and indexed and have metadata and plugins can add whole new ways of seeing the file system layer. It’s a lot.\nHans:\n The thing that’s true of everything that’s highly empirical is that you’re going to get it wrong a lot of the time because nature is just so much more complex than our puny little brains.\nThe actual storage layer is also different.\nHans:\n Reiser4 uses dancing trees, which obsolete the balanced tree algorithms used in databases…This makes Reiser4 more space efficient than other filesystems because we squish small files together rather than wasting space due to block alignment like they do\nHans:\n For some interfaces, Reiser4 performs such switching in intelligent manner without user intervention. Thus, the file system is in permanent evolution, adapting to current conditions.\nHe’s working with his team in Russia. Long nights, endless emails, debates about algorithms and data structures. He’s pushing them hard, demanding perfection. He wants Reiser4 to be the best, the fastest, the most revolutionary filesystem ever created.\nBut he’s also becoming increasingly isolated. His communication style, his relentless pursuit of his vision, it’s creating friction. He’s alienating colleagues, pushing away potential allies. The warning signs are there, flashing brighter than ever.\nAnd meanwhile Nina’s isolation increases. She doesn’t know many people in Oakland. Hans is off in Russia, chasing his dreams of file system domination, leaving Nina to deal with the realities of daily life: two young kids, a new country, a failing marriage.\nNina starts meeting people off craigs list. She’s trying to balance her responsibilities as a mother, her desire for a career, her own personal needs.\nShe’s spending her days at Grand Lake Montessori, this private school where her kids go, this place that’s all about nurturing and child-centered learning. She’s volunteering, helping out in the classrooms, connecting with other parents. She’s trying to create some semblance of normalcy, of stability, in a life that’s spinning out of control.\nAnd into this void steps Sean Sturgeon. Hans’s best friend. A complicated guy. A former truck driver, a self-proclaimed “ex-gay prostitute,” a one-time fixture in the Bay Area S\u0026M scene. Later, when the police are involved, when the Hans and Nina story hits the news, and it does, the salacious details of Nina and Sean affair becomes the center stage.\nBut actually their marital struggles and tension that led to a trial separation was less about affairs and more about parenting.\nRory is five years old. He’s a bright kid, but he’s also struggling. Nightmares, anxiety, behavioral problems. Nina, she’s worried. She takes him to therapists, gets him evaluated. She’s trying to figure out what’s going on, how to help him.\nBut Hans, he’s dismissive. He thinks Nina is overreacting, that Rory’s problems are just a normal part of growing up. He sees Nina’s concern as a tactic in their custody battle, a way to paint him as a bad father.\nNina:\n Our children hardly know their father because he has been home for only months at a time, three times a year.\nHans, he’s got his own ideas about parenting. He believes in toughening up kids, exposing them to the real world. He sees video games, even violent ones as educational, as a way to teach Rory about history, about strategy, about the culture of manhood.\nHans:\n Little boys take to violent computer games like monkeys take to trees. They do not have instincts that favor combat rehearsal activities for no reason, they have them because they affect whether they live or die a significant amount of the time.\nNina, she sees it differently. She sees the nightmares, the anxiety, the drawings of monsters and soldiers. She sees a child who’s struggling, a child who needs a safe and nurturing environment, not a virtual battlefield.\nThe conflict escalates. Hans accuses Nina of manipulating Rory, of turning him against him. And anyways he’s busy, back and forth from Russia, building his perfect file system, his perfectly ordered world of data. And the big struggle he’s having is maybe the size of his ambition because he doesn’t want to talk about his existing widely used ReiserFS V3 file system anymore.\nAnd yeah, that existing version, V3, it’s getting this reputation for being…fragile. Especially when the hardware isn’t perfect. And in the early 2000s, hardware, it wasn’t always perfect. Hard drives crashed, power flickered, things happened. And when things happened, ReiserFS, sometimes it just…fell apart. Data got corrupted, files vanished.\nAnd the Linux community, they’re starting to notice. They’re starting to talk. On mailing lists, in forums, the whispers are growing louder.\nJeff:\n ReiserFS has serious scalability problems…the scalability problems are real.\nJeff Mahoney, a SUSE developer, he’s seeing the writing on the wall. ReiserFS, it’s great for small files, but it doesn’t scale. It can’t handle the massive datasets, the high-volume workloads that are becoming more and more common.\nAnd Hans, he’s dismissive. He’s got this almost messianic belief in his own vision. He’s not interested in patching up ReiserFS. He’s got Reiser4, this next-generation file system, this masterpiece he’s convinced will solve everything.\nHans-Reiser:\n The code was unmaintainable terrible code that needed to be rewritten from scratch…\nHe’s telling SUSE, telling the Linux community, that ReiserFS is obsolete, that they need to move on to 4. He’s not interested in compromise, in collaboration. He’s got his own way, and he’s sticking to it.\nAnd the kernel developers, they’re not having it. They’re seeing Hans’s brilliance, but they’re also seeing his arrogance, his inability to work within a community. Alan Cox, a core Linux developer, he’s worried about the long-term viability of Reiser4.\nAlan-Cox:\n “It doesn’t matter if reiser4 causes crashes. It matters that people can fix them…and the code is maintainable.”\nyeah, What happens if Hans disappears. Who’s going to maintain this complex, unconventional file system? Who’s going to fix the bugs, the inevitable crashes? There is a huge element of trust here, and Hans isn’t interested in building trust. If SuSe is selling paid enterprise support for his existing file system, they need to trust it works. If they don’t, if he’s not helping maintain it and fix issues, why would they ever trust his next idea?\nBut Hans has his vision for a new filesystem world, where all the previous ideas are tossed aside. He doesn’t care about the social elements, or the people he is rubbing the wrong way.\nHans :\n It had to be written from scratch to be written right…\nThat’s Han’s talking to the kernel mailing list. He’s thinking about a world where a simple search can unearth anything and everything, regardless of the application, regardless of the file format.\nBut He’s been butting heads with the Linux kernel developers. He sees them as resistant to change, as unable to grasp the brilliance of his vision.\nHans :\n What makes you think kernel developers have a deep understanding of the value of connectivity in the OS? They don’t. The average kernel developer is not particularly bright.\nAnd the kernel developers, they’re pushing back. Linus Torvalds, the father of Linux, he’s not impressed with Reiser4’s plugin architecture.\nLinus:\n As long as you call them ‘plugins’…I (and I suspect a lot of other people) are totally uninterested…\nUninterested, because they’re worried about the complexity, the stability, the long-term viability of Reiser4. They’re worried about his inability to collaborate, to compromise. They’re seeing a man who’s so focused on his own vision that he’s blind to the practical realities of working within a community, of releasing and maintain code at the scale of heavily used operating system kernel.\nAnd at home, while all this is going on,  he’s accusing Nina of Munchausen by proxy, of weaponizing their son’s health in their custody battle.\nHans:\n “You don’t want the kids except as a bargaining chip.”\nHe’s projecting, blaming Nina for his own failings, for his own inability to connect, to empathize. He’s building this perfect file system, this world of interconnected data, but his own world is fracturing. But he does it, he gets Reiser4 completed.\nHans presents benchmarks for Reiser4. For small files, still a specialty, its much faster than ext3. For metadata operations, like file creation and deletion, it was again, much faster than other linux filesystems. On other benchmarks, large files, concurrency, Hans had benchmarks showing it could be 2 to 3 times faster. Others disputed this, and found hans benchmarks to focus in on the specific scenarios where his filesystem clearly had an advantage, but either way, it existed. His vision had been created.\nAnd then he needs to get it into the linux kernel.\nHans :\n “All objections have now been addressed…I request that reiser4 be included.”\nHe’s fighting for recognition, for his vision to be accepted. It’s a fight that mirrors another battle he’s waging, a brutal custody battle with his now estranged wife, Nina.\nTheir emails are a war zone. He accuses her of Munchausen by proxy, of fabricating illnesses for their son, Rory.\nHans :\n You don’t want the kids except as a bargaining chip. They interfere with your career.\nHe sees her as manipulative, an obstacle to his control over their children. But Nina, she’s just trying to protect her kids, to shield them from his increasingly erratic behavior. She takes Rory to therapy, gets him evaluated.\nNina :\n Rory needs a very safe environment. He needs to thrive.\nShe expresses her fears to friends, worries about the impact of the constant conflict on her children. She wants them to feel safe, loved, protected. She wants to build a stable, nurturing environment for them, far from the toxic battlefield of her marriage.\nMeanwhile, Hans is consumed by the fight. The custody battle, the Reiser4 debates, they’re fueling his anger, his paranoia.\nHans :\n Male geeks…are one of America’s most hated cultural minorities. … I am tired of being the punching bag.\nHe feels misunderstood, unfairly targeted. He lashes out, sends threatening emails.\nHans :\n Those who anger slowly, cool slowly Nina.\nThe stress is mounting, the pressure building. He’s losing his grip, his world spiraling out of control.\nAnd then, Nina disappears. September 3, 2006. She drops the kids off at his house, a normal Sunday afternoon exchange. A hug, a kiss goodbye. And then, nothing. She vanishes without a trace.\nIt’s like a file system corrupted, a system crashing. All that data, all those connections, suddenly fragmented, lost. His wife, the mother of his children, gone. His dream of a unified namespace, of total control over data, a stark contrast to the chaos of his own life. He’s the architect of his own destruction, a brilliant mind consumed by his own demons. He’s about to pay the price for his ambition, his isolation, his inability to connect, to empathize, to see the human cost of his pursuit of control.\nNina’s friend, Ellen became concerned that Nina didn’t pick the kids up from school the next day. That evening she phoned the police to report a missing person. She must have had suspicions because the police had her phone Hans, with them present. She asked him if he might know where Nina was and he immediately said he wanted to talk to his lawyer.\nNot a great sign. So the police, they start watching Hans, following him, but they’re also listening. They’ve got his phones tapped, a wire room set up at headquarters. Officers are working in shifts, headphones on, listening to every conversation, every whispered word. They’re hoping to hear something, anything that will give them a break in the case, a clue to where Nina might be.\nAnd what they hear, it’s not what they expect. It’s not the frantic calls of a worried husband, desperately searching for his missing wife. It’s not the hushed conversations with accomplices, plotting a cover-up. It’s something else entirely.\nIt’s Hans, talking to his mother, Beverly. He’s complaining, ranting, not about Nina’s disappearance, but about Nina herself. About the custody battle, about the divorce, about how she “lied” about their son’s illnesses.\nHans :\n She really was nuts, mom. She really was…and you know, she came up with these illnesses because she hated me.\nHe’s angry, bitter, resentful. He’s talking about Nina in the past tense, like she’s already gone. He’s not showing any remorse, any concern for her well-being.\nMother:\n Still, Nina didn’t deserve whatever it is that happened to her. Don’t you think?\nHans:\n I think my children shouldn’t be endangered by her.\nHis mother, she tries to steer him back, to remind him that Nina, no matter their differences, didn’t deserve whatever happened to her. But Hans, he’s not having it. He’s caught up in his own narrative, his own justifications.\nHans :\n Yeah, well being decent is a mistake, a mistake I paid for heavily.\nThe officers listening, they’re taking notes, marking down the times, the dates, the words. They’re analyzing his tone, his inflections, the pauses, the hesitations. They’re building a profile, a psychological portrait of a man consumed by anger, a man who seems more concerned with winning a custody battle than finding his missing wife.\nMeanwhile, the investigation is intensifying. They’ve searched Hans’s home, not once, but twice. They’ve found traces of Nina’s blood, mixed with Hans’s, on a pillar in the living room. They’ve found more of her blood in his car, on a sleeping bag stuff sack. The passenger seat’s missing, the floor looks scrubbed clean. There are books on homicide in his car. It’s all starting to add up, a pattern emerging from the noise.\nAnd then, there’s the car chase. Hans, spotted driving his mother’s Honda, leads police on a wild goose chase through the Oakland hills, dodging and weaving, trying to shake his tail. He abandons the car, sprints through the neighborhood, disappears into the night. He’s acting like a guilty man, a man with something to hide.\nThe police, they’re convinced. They announce Hans Reiser as a suspect in Nina’s disappearance. The media, they’re all over it, cameras flashing, microphones thrust in faces. The pressure’s mounting, the public scrutiny intensifying.\nHans gets a lawyer who tries to downplay the evidence, calling it “flimsy,” “circumstantial.” Saying Hans is just a computer guy, a bit eccentric, not a killer. But the police, they’ve got their man. They’re just waiting for the final piece of the puzzle to fall into place. They’re waiting for Hans to crack, to confess, to lead them to Nina. But Hans, he’s not talking. For him truth is a variable, waiting to be assigned, waiting altering, updated and incremented. And as the investigation continues, the question hangs heavy in the air: Where is Nina? Will they find her? Or will Hans Reiser, the architect of a revolutionary file system, become the architect of his own escape?\nFast forward to 2007. and in Oakland it’s a media circus. TV trucks, reporters, bloggers, all jostling for position. Inside, a courtroom drama is unfolding, a real-life tragedy playing out in real time.\nThe prosecution methodically lays out their case. They show the jury the last known images of Nina, shopping with her kids, just hours before she vanished. They present the blood evidence, Nina’s blood in Hans’s house, in his car. They highlight his erratic behavior. They call witness after witness, each one painting a picture of a man consumed by anger, a man capable of violence.\nThe defense tries to counter this narrative. They attempt to portray Nina as manipulative, unstable, a woman who might still be alive, hiding somewhere to punish him. They bring up her affair, trying to shift the blame, to create reasonable doubt. They talk about Hans’s personality, his quirks, his social awkwardness. They say he’s just a programmer, a bit different, not a killer.\nAnd then, Hans takes the stand. He’s wearing a suit, trying to project an image of composure, of innocence. He tells his story, his version of the truth. He denies killing Nina. He says he doesn’t know where she is.\nBut under the pressure of cross-examination, the facade crumbles. He’s evasive, condescending, arrogant. He contradicts himself, gets caught in lies. He admits to perjury, to hiding evidence. He stumbled over questions about the missing passenger seat from his car, offering a series of shifting explanations. Yeah, the seat of his car is just gone, with no real explanation, besides it made it better for sleeping in the car. The car is also soaking wet on the inside when they take it, as if hosed off. Plus Nina’s blood in the car and at his house. He also has his passport and a lot of cash in fanny pack. Its all circumstantial but yeah … come on.\nHe admitted to perjury, to intentionally misleading the jury. And then there were the missing hard drives, given to his lawyer months before but only revealed during the trial.\nAnd then there were the murder books. “Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets”, the behind the scenes look at Baltimore homicide investigators that would eventually lead to the the show “The Wire” and “Masterpieces of Murder” as true crime book. Both bought together with cash from a local Barnes and Noble.\nHe tried to explain away the books, saying he bought them out of an “arrogance of innocence”. And this part maybe seems true, well the arrogance part. He was a smart person, and cocky and thought if he had a plan and did some research, he could get away with everything. Not even thinking of the optics of heading to the local book store and buying all the books on ‘murder’ to help craft a plan.\nAnd then, that moment of tension. The jury delivers the verdict: guilty, first-degree murder. As Hans is led away, he utters those chilling words: “I’ve been the best father that I know how.” A desperate attempt to justify the unjustifiable.\nThe Linux community, they’re watching all of this unfold. And their reactions, they’re all over the map.\nJonathan Corbet, the editor of LWN.net, a respected Linux news site, writes an article analyzing the impact of Reiser’s conviction. He talks about Reiser’s technical brilliance, his innovative ideas, but also about his flaws, his “disregard for the rest of the community,” his “certainty of always being right.” He acknowledges the loss to the community, the loss of a “voice which, for all its faults, had some unique and innovative things to say.”\nBut in the comment sections, in the online forums, a different story unfolds. A raw, unfiltered, and often unsettling reaction. There’s shock, disbelief, of course. But there’s also something else, something darker.\nSome comments focus on the technical implications. What will happen to ReiserFS? Will Reiser4 ever see the light of day? Will someone else take over the projects? Or will they be abandoned, tainted by their creator’s crimes? There’s talk of renaming the filesystem, of erasing Reiser’s name from the code, of distancing themselves from the scandal.\nAnd then there are the jokes, the dark humor, the casual cruelty. “At least they’ll let him code in prison,” one commenter quips. Another suggests, “Maybe he’ll create something even better now that he has plenty of time.” A disturbing lack of empathy, a strange disconnect from the human tragedy at the heart of it all.\nOthers express genuine concern, for Nina, for her children, for the impact on the open-source community. They worry about the negative stereotypes, the headlines screaming “Linux :: murder!” They lament the loss of a brilliant mind, a wasted talent.\nBut the silence from the leaders of the Linux community, it’s deafening. His legacy, once a source of pride, is now shrouded in shame. His brilliance, once celebrated, is now overshadowed by the darkness of his crimes.\nAnd as the Linux community grapples with the fallout, a question lingers: What happens when the code we create, the technology we build, becomes entangled with the dark parts of human nature?\nBut there’s still a piece missing, a gaping hole in the story. Nina’s body has never been found. If you believe hans, if his filesystem has been serving you well all these years, if you’ve seen his google talks, if you think he’s a genius and someone to look up to, you might just rationalize things away. He said it on the stand, computer people might be quirky, but we shouldn’t be assumed to be evil because of it.\nI think for a brief time, people like me, who maybe weren’t popular in highschool, who spend a lot of time indoors with a computer, they identify with that message, and think Hans is maybe a stand in for our own past persecutions. He’s just a nerd being picked on by the world.\nBut that’s where the plea bargain comes in. A deal is struck and on a hot July afternoon in 2008, A convoy of police cars snakes its way through the Oakland hills, up into Redwood Regional Park. A SWAT team, armed with rifles, scans the dense undergrowth. Inside a caged van, Hans Reiser sits handcuffed to his lawyer.\nThey arrive at a remote parking lot, the end of the road. Hans leads them down a narrow deer trail, the air thick with the smell of pine and eucalyptus.\nHans stops. He points.\nHans:\n If you dig down two feet, you’re going to hit Nina’s toes.\nThe officers exchange glances. They start digging and they find her or what remains. And for his cooperation, his sentence is reduced to 2nd degree murder.\nSo, Hans Reiser is in prison, his legacy forever tainted by his crime. But what about his code, his creation, ReiserFS? What about the dream of Reiser4, the filesystem he believed would revolutionize the Linux world?\nIt’s a story of what might have been, a story of unrealized potential. Reiser4, despite its technical innovations, never quite makes it. It’s a complex filesystem, with features like “dancing trees” and a plugin architecture that promised flexibility and performance. But it’s also a filesystem burdened by its creator’s past.\nThe Linux community, already wary of Hans Reiser’s abrasive personality and unconventional coding style, now grapples with the implications of his crime. Trust is broken. The enthusiasm for Reiser4 wanes.\nAnd as the community debates the merits of Reiser4, other filesystems step into the spotlight. Ext4, building on the familiar foundation of ext3, emerges as a stable and reliable option, quickly becoming the default choice for many Linux distributions. And ext4 is a group effort, various experienced linux developers working together to get it working and into the kernel.\nBtrfs, with its advanced features and focus on data integrity, gains a following among those seeking a more modern and robust filesystem. XFS, known for its high performance with large files, continues to be a strong contender in the enterprise space.\nReiser4, meanwhile, languishes. It lacks the corporate backing needed to drive its development and integration into the mainline kernel. And also unlike ext4, there is only a singular person, Hans pushing for it. And from his prison cell his voice is now a whisper, lost in the noise of the rapidly evolving Linux community.\nEdward Shishkin, a former Namesys employee, picks up the torch, continuing to develop Reiser4, even releasing a new version, Reiser5. But without Hans’s drive and vision, without the support of the community, the project struggles to gain momentum.\nAnd as the years pass, as the Linux kernel evolves, ReiserFS is marked as obsolete, slated for removal. The code, once so innovative, becomes a footnote in the history of Linux filesystems. A reminder that technical brilliance alone is not enough. That true progress requires not just code, but collaboration, community, and a shared vision for the future.\nNow known as inmate G31008, Hans His legacy, once a testament to innovation in the Linux world, is now overshadowed by a single, horrific act.\nBut he gets a letter asking about this thoughts on Reiser3 being slated for removal from the linux kernel. And from his prison cell, Hans Reiser writes. A 6,500-word letter to the Linux Kernel Mailing List, a community he once clashed with. It’s a letter filled with regrets, reflections, and a plea for understanding.\nHans:\n The man I am now would do things very differently from how I did things then.\nHe reflects on the early days of ReiserFS, recalling the struggles to make it perform competitively. He admits to a crucial social misstep, a failure to acknowledge the work of others. He expresses regret for not appreciating his team more.\nHe acknowledges the technical challenges of Reiser4 and the social missteps that hindered its acceptance.\nHans:\n The problem was that it didn’t use the code that had been written by others in the kernel community, and people don’t really like their code not being used. People want to feel included. I responded to their social need by, well, screwing the pooch in response.\nHe talks about the prison workshops, the lessons he’s learning about conflict resolution. He thanks Edward Shishkin for his work on Reiser5, though he admits he doesn’t know what’s in it, due to his lack of internet access. He encourages the community to support the project, disentangling it from his own tarnished reputation. It’s a complex letter, a glimpse into the mind of a man grappling with his past. He closes with a poignant reflection:\nHans:\n It has been an honor to be of even passing value to the users of Linux.\nRightfully, this story should be about Nina. She’s the one who lost her life. But there’s something important here. A thing I thought should be said. Your technical and social skills—they work together. They multiply when working together. Maybe here, with Hans they divide.\nI’m not saying your difficult colleague is a murderer, But these things, they are not not connected. Hans struggled with empathy. Frankly I struggle with empathy sometimes. And Hans is going to be out, probably in not too long and I hope he gets better at that. And thinking of others. I hope we all get better at that.\nSo, yeah, back what I’ve learned from my wife. How she can spot problems in people I’ve given a pass to. Well, I think how you interact with people matters. You can’t separate the art from the artist, because they are all tied up together. The coworker you have that some women in the office refuse to work with - a real story I’ve heard. Or that mean-spirited person that just gets a lot of good work done. And they shouldn’t get a pass.\nWe do ourselves no favors when we rationalize, defend, or rally behind people whose lack of empathy makes them dangerous. And yeah my wife has this knack for seeing through the facade, for sensing when something’s off. But really we all have that. And maybe that’s what we need more of in tech—a little less focus on the code and a little more on the character. Understand the people, and their motivations. Because, in the end, it’s all connected.\nEven Hans touched on this lesson in his letter to the linux mailing list:\nHans:\n The man I was then presented papers with benchmarks showing that ReiserFS was faster than ext2. The man I am now would start his papers crediting them for being faster than the filesystems of other operating systems, and thanking them for the years we used their filesystem to write ours. Not doing that was my first serious social mistake in the Linux community, and it was completely unnecessary.\nReiserFS was named after Hans, who often spoke of his grand vision. But what about his team in Russia? Who were they? What ideas were theirs? What crucial work should be credited to Hans, and what to his unnamed team? How did they endure his challenging personality? This is the true purpose of the letter.\nHans:\n In prison I have been working quite hard on developing my social skills, especially my conflict resolution and conflict avoidance skills…It has changed me.\nHans:\n Assuming that the decision is to remove V3 from the kernel, I have just one request: that for one last release the README be edited to add Mikhail Gilula, Konstantin Shvachko, and Anatoly Pinchuk to the credits, and to delete anything in there I might have said about why they were not credited. It is time to let go.\nThat was the show!\nHans’ request was granted. A patch email was sent to the Linux mailing list, updating the readme. ReiserFS will be dropped from Linux in 2025, but for now, the readme better reflects the teamwork it took to build it.\nI’m deeply indebted for this episode to the myriad of coverage of Han’s trial. Espeically Henry K. Lee for his thorough reporting in Presumed Dead and to Fredrick Brennan for sharing Hans’s letter and for the web archive’s way back machine, because this didn’t happen that long ago, but a lot the webpages seem lost in the sands of time.\nAll quoted dialogue here is exact quotes, from Henry’s book, from emails, from reporting on the case, trial transcripts or somewhere else. But I’m sure i got some things wrong, because I’m just a guy, clicking around, reading web pages and writing down my thoughts. So forgive me any error.\nThank you Nina Reiser’s family, I’m sorry you have to go through this. I hope for a brighter future for her children, Rory and Nio.\nAnd Thank you to all the people who sent me interesting links, like this linux mailing list link and thanks to the supporters who keep me at this, even though I’m new to a job and seem to struggle to find the type of investment of time an episode really needs. If you want to join the supporters and show you appreciate for the show go to corecursive.com/supporters. We also have a pretty awesome slack channel you can find on the website.\nAnd until next time, thank you so much for listening.\n\n      Hello, I make CoRecursive because I love it when someone shares the details behind some project, some bug, or some incident with me. \n    \n  \n      No other podcast was telling stories quite like I wanted to hear.\n    \n \n      Right now this is all done by just me and I love doing it, but it's also exhausting. \n    \n \n      Recommending the show to others and contributing to this patreon are the biggest things you can do to help out.\n    \n \n      Whatever you can do to help, I truly appreciate it!\n      Thanks!

Номер триста\nСпециалисты Microsoft заявляют, что конфисковали 240 доменов и нарушили работу фишингового сервиса ONNX, работавшего по модели «фишинг как услуга» (Phishing-as-a-Service, PhaaS). Также исследователи обнародовали данные египтянина, который предположительно управляет ONNX.\nПо информации Microsoft, ONNX (также известный как Caffeine и FUHRER) активен с 2017 года и в первой половине 2024 года был ведущим фишинговым сервисом по объему отправленных сообщений. Так, ежемесячно через ONNX отправлялись десятки и сотни миллионов фишинговых писем, адресованных как клиентам Microsoft 365, так и других компаний.\nONNX предлагал своим пользователям фишинг-киты, предназначенные для атак на разные компании технологического сектора, включая Google, DropBox, Rackspace и Microsoft. Сервис рекламировал и продавал свои фишинговые наборы в Telegram, предлагая несколько уровней подписки (Basic, Professional и Enterprise) стоимостью от 150 до 550 долларов в месяц.\n\nОтмечается, что сами атаки тоже управлялись через ботов в Telegram и имели встроенные механизмы обхода двухфакторной аутентификации (2ФА). В последнее время атаки в основном были направлены на сотрудников финансовых организаций (банков, кредитных союзов и частных финансовых фирм) с использованием фишинговых QR-кодов.\nТо есть письма злоумышленников содержали PDF-вложения с вредоносными QR-кодами, которые перенаправляли потенциальных жертв на страницы, напоминающие легитимные страницы для входа в Microsoft 365, где жертв просили ввести учетные данные.\nИсследователи объясняют, что люди обычно сканируют QR-коды на своих личных мобильных устройствах, и в результате такие атаки крайне сложно отследить и предотвратить с помощью традиционных защитных решений.\nДля перехвата 2ФА использовался «пуленепробиваемый» хостинг и зашифрованный код JavaScript, который расшифровывался во время загрузки страницы, добавляя дополнительный уровень обфускации, чтобы избежать обнаружения антифишинговыми сканерами.\nРабота ONNX внезапно прервалась еще в июне текущего года, после того как исследователи из Dark Atlas выяснили и раскрыли личность владельца сервиса —  гражданина Египта Абануба Нади (Abanoub Nady), также известного в сети под ником MRxC0DER. Теперь эту информацию подтверждают и аналитики Microsoft.\n\nТакже теперь же в Microsoft сообщают, что по решению суда компания получила контроль над «вредоносной технической инфраструктурой» сервиса, и благодаря этому Microsoft «навсегда прекращает использование этих доменов для фишинговых атак в будущем».\nОтмечается, что конфискацию 240 доменов помогала осуществить организация Linux Foundation, которой принадлежат название и логотип ONNX (для Open Neural Network Exchange).\nТолько важные новости и лучшие статьи\n\n        Подписаться\n      \n",

    "content": "${lead}    \n${lead}    \n\n        Freie Software ist eine feine Sache – verschiedene Lizenztypen können aber ausbremsen, wenn die Auflagen nicht zum Einsatz passen. Ein Überblick.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Midjourney, Collage: iX)\n    \nDie Vorteile von Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) sind schnell erläutert: Sie macht qualitativ hochwertige, von vielen Parteien getestete Softwarekomponenten verfügbar – die man im Optimalfall schnell in eigene Projekte einbauen kann. Darunter liegt ein idealistisches Fundament, welches Information zu einem Allgemeingut erklärt, das frei für alle verfügbar sein sollte. Richard M. Stallmann, Gründer der Free Software Foundation (FSF) und Initiatior des GNU-Projekts, kann als geistiger Vater der mittlerweile schon vierzig Jahre alten Bewegung gelten.\n\n          Manuela Astrid Weixlbaumer ist Juristin und als IP Specialist sowie als Compliance Officer für den Automatisierungsspezialisten KEBA in Linz/Österreich tätig.\n        \nFür Entwickler und Entwicklerinnen ist das erst einmal eine praktische Sache – im Unternehmenskontext kann die Verwendung von FOSS aber anecken und Fragen aufwerfen. Die Lizenz-Landschaft für freie Software ist im Wandel, es gibt Abstufungen und Folgewirkungen. Immer wieder stand der Copyleft-Effekt im Schlaglicht: Offene Software, die gemeinsam mit proprietärer eingesetzt wird, \"infiziere\" mit ihrer Lizenz – die das Offenlegen von Quellcode erfordert – auch die geschlossenen Teile eines hybriden Produkts. In vielen Unternehmen wünscht man sich daher mittlerweile Safelists. Sie geben an, welche Lizenzen einzusetzen sind, worin sie sich unterscheiden und in welchen Bereichen erhöhte Sorgfalt geboten ist.\nFOSS dient als der neutrale Sammelbegriff für Free and Open Source Software – er vereint den liberal-idealistischen Ansatz von Richard M. Stallman mit dem eher pragmatischen Einschlag von Linus Torvalds. FOSS bedeutet, dass Software frei und ohne Zahlung von Lizenzgebühren verwendet werden kann. Und der Source Code ist frei zugänglich, die Nutzer dürfen die Software verändern und weitergeben.\nNah verwandt mit FOSS sind Freeware, Shareware und Public Domain. Sie unterscheiden sich aber zum Teil signifikant von FOSS, insbesondere Free- und Shareware, die oft kommerzieller Software zugeordnet werden. Kommerzielle Software, proprietäre Software und Closed Source stehen FOSS dementsprechend gegensätzlich gegenüber. FOSS kennt drei Hauptkategorien von Lizenzen: strenge Copyleft-Lizenzen, Lizenzen mit eingeschränktem Copyleft und permissive Lizenzen.\nCopyleft ist so etwas wie der kleine Bruder des Copyrights, wobei es im Gegensatz zum Copyright die Freiheit regelt, zu kopieren, zu verändern und zu verbreiten. Dabei taucht das Copyleft nicht nur im Softwarebereich, sondern auch generell im Bereich urheberrechtlicher Lizenzen auf. In Bezug auf FOSS bedeutet Copyleft, dass Software, die unter einer Copyleft-Lizenz steht oder von ihr abgeleitet ist (derivative work bzw. abgeleitetes Werk), ausschließlich unter den Lizenzbedingungen der FOSS-Lizenz weiterverbreitet werden darf. Der Begriff des abgeleiteten Werks ist dabei das maßgebliche Kriterium, ob Copyleft eintritt oder nicht.\nIn der Praxis heißt das, dass die Software wieder unter der gleichen Copyleft-Lizenz verbreitet werden muss. Je nach Lizenztext muss das dieselbe Lizenz sein oder kann auch eine spätere Version referenzieren – so ist es beispielsweise bei der GPL (GNU General Public License), die es mit \"only\"- oder \"or-later\"-Auflagen gibt.\nEs ist somit nicht möglich, eine Copyleft-Software unter eine permissive oder proprietäre Lizenz zu stellen. Die Software bleibt für die Community erhalten – und letztere ist ebenfalls befugt, sie unter den Lizenzbedingungen zu modifizieren und weiterzuverbreiten.\nIn Unternehmen kann das erhebliche Auswirkungen haben, da mit Copyleft-Lizenzen auch Verpflichtungen wie die Offenlegung des Quellcodes einhergehen – der berüchtigte \"virale Effekt\". Je nach Umfang und Qualität der verbundenen proprietären Komponenten kann das für Unternehmen unverantwortlich sein, weil so potenziell Sicherheitslücken oder Betriebsgeheimnisse an die Öffentlichkeit gelangen könnten. Ein Paradebeispiel für eine Copyleft-Lizenz ist die GPL-2.0, ihre überarbeitete Version GPL-3.0, sowie die AGPL-3.0, die CPL-1.0 und die EPL-1.0.\nDer Klassiker – und besonders praxisrelevant – ist dabei die GPL-2.0, unter der auch der Linux Kernel lizenziert ist. Durch zahlreiche Judikaturbeispiele hat sie sich mittlerweile zu einem Standard entwickelt. Die erste bahnbrechende Entscheidung diesbezüglich war in Deutschland die des Landgerichts München I (Az. 21 O 6123/04 vom 19.5.2004), die der GPL-2.0 den Status von AGB zuerkannte und ihre Wirksamkeit in Deutschland bestätigte. Die 2007 eingeführte GPL-3.0 ergänzte daraufhin bestehende Lücken in der GPL-2.0, beispielsweise im Hinblick auf Tivoisierung, die mit der GPL-3.0 wesentlich erschwert wird. Dabei handelt es sich um das Verbauen von proprietärer Software auf Geräten, die ursprünglich mit freier Software liefen.\nDie Anforderungen der GPL-2.0 und GPL-3.0 gelten für alle Versionen der Programme, die unter den Lizenzen vertrieben werden. Das bedeutet, dass jede Weitergabe eines Programms, ob unverändert oder modifiziert, den Lizenzbedingungen entsprechen muss. Zu den zentralen Verpflichtungen gehören:\nUnter Lizenzen mit eingeschränktem Copyleft fällt insbesondere die GPL mit ihren Ausnahmen wie der Linking Exception oder der Classpath Exception. Ein Paradebeispiel dafür ist die LGPL (Lesser General Public License), die es ebenfalls in mehreren Versionen gibt. Sie sieht Ausnahmen vom strengen Copyleft bei dynamischer Verlinkung von Programmbestandteilen, insbesondere von Bibliotheken, vor. Eine dynamische Verlinkung – im Gegensatz zur statischen Verlinkung – verhindert demnach, dass ein abgeleitetes Werk entsteht, die Klausel ist also entscheidend für das Auslösen des Copylefts.\nHier entsteht nur eine lose Verbindung zwischen zwei Softwarekomponenten, die für sich bestehen bleiben. Solche Ausnahmen können so ein starkes Copyleft zu einem schwachen Copyleft machen. Sie zeigen auch deutlich, wie ausschlaggebend die technische Umsetzung, beispielsweise in Form einer Verlinkung, für die Geltung von Lizenzbestimmungen sein kann.\nDie prominentesten Vertreter der permissiven Lizenzen sind unter anderem die MIT-Lizenz, die BSD-Clauses oder die Apache-Lizenzen. Es handelt sich dabei um Lizenzen ohne Copyleft-Klausel und mit geringeren Lizenzanforderungen. Die Apache-Lizenz ist in mehreren Versionen verfügbar. Sie ordnet bei abgeleiteten Werken kein Copyleft an, verpflichtet aber dennoch zum Einhalten von bestimmten Lizenzanforderungen wie dem Anbringen von Copyright-Vermerken, dem Beifügen des Lizenztextes und eines Haftungsausschlusses (Disclaimer).\nDie MIT-Lizenz ist extrem liberal, ihre einzige Bedingung ist das Bereitstellen des Lizenztextes und des Copyright-Vermerks. Entwickler können die modifizierte Software also auch unter einer neuen Lizenz veröffentlichen, solange die Bedingungen der permissiven Lizenz erfüllt sind – wie die Beibehaltung des Copyright-Vermerks und Lizenztextes. Das kann eine andere Open-Source-Lizenz oder aber eine proprietäre Lizenz sein.\nIn der Regel lassen sich permissive Lizenzen auch untereinander kombinieren. Dabei hat Kompatibilität von Lizenzen eine erhebliche Praxisrelevanz: Wenn Lizenz A zum Beispiel etwas ermöglicht, was Lizenz B ausschließt, sind sie nicht miteinander vereinbar – insbesondere ist das wieder im Copyleft-Bereich häufig der Fall.\nWenn sich ein Unternehmen nun damit auseinandersetzt, wie und welche Lizenzen es verwendet, dann ist eine genaue Dokumentation (Bill of Materials, BOM) im Vorhinein unerlässlich. Sie gibt schließlich die Auskunft über die eingesetzten FOSS-Komponenten in einem Produkt. Als Mindestanforderung gibt sie eine eigene Komponentenbezeichnung mit deren FOSS-Lizenzen in der jeweiligen Version an. Eine Safelist kann helfen, sollte aber nur als Orientierungshilfe dienen.\nWichtig ist natürlich auch die Instruktion des Personals: Juristisch betraute Personen im Betrieb bringen im Idealfall grundsätzliches Interesse am Programmieren mit, während zumindest eine Person im jeweiligen Entwicklerteam auch ein Auge auf die Lizenzierung der Komponenten hat, die das Team verwendet. Der Markt hält hier auch Scanning-Werkzeuge bereit, die dabei helfen, FOSS zu analysieren – im Zweifelsfall helfen solche Werkzeuge zwar, Rechtssicherheit herzustellen, sie sind aber nicht als alleiniges Entscheidungsinstrument geeignet. Die letzte Prüfung muss daher immer eine verantwortliche Person durchführen.\nEs wird dabei stets auf die Frage hinauslaufen: \"Wie können wir die FOSS-Komponente so in das Projekt einbauen, dass wir lizenzkonform agieren?\" Und wenn das nicht möglich ist, dann spalten sich die Optionen in zwei Pfade auf: Gibt es eine Alternative unter Einbeziehung einer kommerziellen oder permissiven Lizenz? Oder sollen wir die benötigte Komponente selbst programmieren?\n\n\n\n(kki)\n\n\n\n    Alle Themen der kommenden iX im Überblick.

Das Unternehmen hat das Konzept bereits potenziellen Kunden wie Condé Nast, Eventbrite und Priceline präsentiert. Mit diesem Schritt würde OpenAI direkt mit Google konkurrieren, das den Browsermarkt mit Chrome dominiert. Eine unmittelbare Veröffentlichung ist jedoch nicht geplant. \nGleichzeitig steht Google unter Druck von Wettbewerbshütern. Das US-Justizministerium fordert den Verkauf von Chrome und möglicherweise auch Android. Auch die EU-Kommission untersucht Googles Geschäftspraktiken im Hinblick auf den Digital Markets Act. \nOpenAI hat für das Browserprojekt erfahrene Entwickler rekrutiert, darunter Ben Goodger (ehemals Firefox und Chrome) und Darin Fisher (The Browser Company, Mozilla, Google). Das Projekt soll Teil eines \"Natural Language Web\" werden, bei dem Nutzer mit Webseiten wie mit einem KI-Chatbot interagieren können. \nJetzt ist es offiziell: Das KI-Startup Anthropic vertieft seine Zusammenarbeit mit Amazon Web Services. Amazon investiert dazu weitere 4 Milliarden US-Dollar und wird damit zum primären Cloud- und Trainingspartner von Anthropic. Die Anthropic-Ingenieure sollen dabei eng mit Annapurna Labs, einer Tochtergesellschaft von AWS, zusammenarbeiten. Diese steckt hinter den Trainium-Chips. Sie sind auf das Training von Machine-Learning-Modellen spezialisiert. Ziel der Partnerschaft soll es sein, die Effizienz der Hardware weiter zu optimieren. Anthropic will davon beim Training seiner Foundation-Modelle um die Claude-Familie profitieren. Amazons Gesamtinvestition in das Startup erhöht sich damit auf 8 Milliarden US-Dollar. Das Unternehmen bleibt allerdings Minderheitsinvestor. Zu den weiteren Investoren gehören unter anderem die Google Mutter Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple und Nvidia. \nDie Künstliche Intelligenz ist dabei, die Art und Weise, wie wir mit Rechnern und dem Internet interagieren, zu revolutionieren. Wäre da nicht ein wichtiges Problem: Wir wissen weiterhin nicht genau, wie große Sprachmodelle wirklich funktionieren – oder warum sie so gut funktionieren. Ein Team bei Google Deepmind, das sich mit der sogenannten mechanistischen Interpretierbarkeit beschäftigt, hat an neuen Methoden gearbeitet, die es uns ermöglichen sollen, unter die Haube der KI zu blicken.\nDas Tool Gemma Scope soll Forschenden helfen, zu verstehen, was passiert, wenn generative Systeme eine Ausgabe erzeugen. \"Ein Hauptziel der mechanistischen Interpretierbarkeit ist der Versuch, die Algorithmen innerhalb dieser Systeme praktisch zurückzuentwickeln\", sagt Neel Nanda, der das Team leitet. Um Merkmale – oder Datenkategorien, die ein größeres Konzept darstellen – in Googles KI-Modell Gemma zu finden, hat Deepmind ein Tool namens \"Sparse Autoencoder\" auf jede seiner zahlreichen Schichten angewendet. Man kann sich einen Sparse-Autoencoder wie ein Mikroskop vorstellen, das diese Schichten vergrößert und einen Blick auf ihre Details ermöglicht.\nDer knifflige Teil von Autoencodern besteht darin, zu entscheiden, wie granular sie sein sollen. Die Lösung von Deepmind bestand darin, Sparse-Autoencoder unterschiedlicher Größe laufen zu lassen und so die Anzahl der Merkmale zu variieren, die der Autoencoder finden soll. So lassen sich die Ursachen für Bias oder Fehler in Sprachmodellen aufspüren und entsprechend auch beheben. Mechanistische Interpretierbarkeit könnte ein plausibler Weg zum sogenannten Alignment sein – einem Prozess, der sicherstellt, dass die KI tatsächlich das tut, was wir von ihr erwarten. Gemma und die Autoencoder sind quelloffen, sodass dieses Projekt darauf abzielt, weitere interessierte Forschende dazu anzuregen, sich anzusehen, was die Software gefunden hat und neue Erkenntnisse über die interne Logik des Modells zu gewinnen. \nEine Kommission des US-Kongresses empfiehlt ein massives \"Manhattan-Projekt\"-ähnliches Programm zur Entwicklung einer Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), um im Wettbewerb mit China die Führung zu übernehmen. Dazu sollen führende KI-Unternehmen langfristige Verträge und Finanzierungen erhalten.\nZum Schutz vor chinesischer Industriespionage werden strengere Gesetze vorgeschlagen, etwa zur Genehmigung chinesischer Beteiligungen an US-Biotech-Firmen, Beschränkungen für den Import bestimmter chinesischer Technologien sowie Verbote für chinesische Investoren, Vorstandssitze in strategischen US-Technologiesektoren zu übernehmen.\nChina misst KI eine zentrale Rolle in der künftigen Militärstrategie bei, um Schwachstellen der US-Streitkräfte auszunutzen. Das Land hat stark in KI-Ausbildung investiert und führt bei der Zahl der KI-Forschungsartikel vor den USA. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob der Kongress dem Vorschlag folgen wird.\n\n    Mit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externer Podcast (Podigee GmbH) geladen.\n  \n\n    Ich bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.\n    Damit können personenbezogene Daten an Drittplattformen (Podigee GmbH) übermittelt werden.\n    Mehr dazu in unserer\n    Datenschutzerklärung.\n  \nApple entwickelt eine neue Version seines digitalen Assistenten Siri mit fortgeschrittenen Sprachmodellen. Die intern als \"LLM Siri\" bezeichnete Version soll menschenähnlichere Gespräche ermöglichen und komplexere Anfragen verarbeiten können. Laut Bloomberg wird die neue Siri-Version aber erst 2025 angekündigt und frühestens im Frühjahr 2026 für Nutzerinnen und Nutzer verfügbar sein. Apple testet sie derzeit als separate App auf iPhones, iPads und Macs. Langfristig soll die Technologie die bestehende Siri-Oberfläche komplett ersetzen. Bis zum Start plant Apple einige Zwischenschritte, wie die Integration von ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence im kommenden Monat. Die neue Siri soll alle diese Fähigkeiten direkt integrieren - mit besonderem Fokus auf Datenschutz. Apple könnte aber weiterhin Zugriff auf spezialisierte KI-Systeme von Drittanbietern anbieten. \n\n          Wie intelligent ist Künstliche Intelligenz eigentlich? Welche Folgen hat generative KI für unsere Arbeit, unsere Freizeit und die Gesellschaft? Im \"KI-Update\" von Heise bringen wir Euch gemeinsam mit The Decoder werktäglich Updates zu den wichtigsten KI-Entwicklungen. Freitags beleuchten wir mit Experten die unterschiedlichen Aspekte der KI-Revolution.\n        \nDas KI-Start-up Genmo hat sein Videomodell Mochi 1 als bisher größtes öffentlich verfügbares KI-Modell zur Videogenerierung veröffentlicht. Mit 10 Milliarden Parametern soll es bei Bewegungsqualität und Umsetzung von Textanweisungen neue Maßstäbe setzen. Mochi 1 kann Videos mit 30 FPS und bis zu 5,4 Sekunden Länge in 480p-Auflösung erzeugen. Es simuliert physikalische Effekte wie Flüssigkeiten sowie Fell- und Haarbewegungen realistisch, ist aber für fotorealistische Inhalte optimiert. Eine 720p-Version soll noch 2024 folgen. Das Modell basiert auf einer neuen \"Asymmetric Diffusion Transformer\"-Architektur, die Text und Video getrennt verarbeitet. In Benchmarks erreicht es eine höhere Genauigkeit bei der Umsetzung von Prompts und realistischere Bewegungen als Konkurrenzmodelle. Code und Gewichte stehen unter der Apache-2.0-Lizenz zur Verfügung. \nEin Kryptowährung-Interessierter verlor 2500 US-Dollar, nachdem er Code von ChatGPT verwendete, der eine betrügerische Solana-API enthielt. Er wollte einen \"Bump Bot\" für Kryptowährungshandel programmieren und vertraute dabei dem von ChatGPT vorgeschlagenen Code, der seinen privaten Schlüssel über die API übertrug.\nDer Vorfall offenbart mehrere grundlegende Sicherheitsfehler: Die Verwendung eines Produktivkontos für Entwicklungszwecke und die Preisgabe eines privaten Schlüssels. Der Betrüger konnte innerhalb von 30 Minuten alle Krypto-Assets aus der Wallet abziehen.\nDer Geschädigte meldete den Vorfall an OpenAI und das betrügerische Repository an GitHub, das daraufhin entfernt wurde. Der Fall zeigt, dass KI-generierte Ergebnisse nicht blind vertraut werden sollten und eine kritische Überprüfung notwendig ist.\nDer generativen künstlichen Intelligenz wird zugeschrieben, digitale Büroarbeit effizienter zu machen und Zeitersparnis zu schaffen – doch laut einer Studie von Intel hapert es dabei noch: Die Befragung habe ergeben, dass Anwender an einem der neuen KI-PCs, also einem Rechner mit NPU (Neural Processing Unit), mehr Zeit für Computerarbeiten aufwendeten als diejenigen, die an einem normalen PC oder Laptop saßen. Intel bezeichnete das als eine \"beunruhigende Statistik\". Potenzial für Zeitersparnis mit KI wäre bei den vielen Routine-Aufgaben am Rechner durchaus vorhanden. Doch warum helfen die KI-PCs nicht? Als möglichen Grund dafür sieht der Chiphersteller, dass zahlreiche KI-Nutzer noch viel Zeit damit zubrächten, herauszufinden, wie sie am besten mit KI-Chatbots kommunizieren, um auch die gewünschten Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Daraus folgt für Intel, dass noch großer Aufklärungsbedarf herrscht. Unternehmen, die KI-gestützte Produkte anbieten, sollten deshalb mehr Informationen über Implementierung und Nutzung bieten, damit das Potenzial Künstlicher Intelligenz wirklich gehoben werden könne. \nMicrosoft hat AI Shell als öffentliche Preview-Version veröffentlicht. Das Projekt stattet die Shell mit KI-Fähigkeiten aus, bietet Interaktionsmöglichkeiten mit KI-Agenten von Azure OpenAI sowie Copilot in Azure und lässt sich wahlweise als eigenständige Anwendung oder mit Microsofts Open-Source-Shell PowerShell 7 nutzen. AI Shell besteht aus einem Kommandozeilen-Shell-Interface, einem Framework zum Erstellen von KI-Agenten, einem PowerShell-Modul und zwei integrierten KI-Agenten: Der Azure-OpenAI-Agent kann ein beliebiges von Azure OpenAI bereitgestelltes KI-Modell nutzen und eignet sich laut Microsoft für eine breite Spannweite von Anfragen, Natural-Language-Interpretationen und Codegenerierung. Das KI-gestützte Tool Copilot in Azure liegt als Preview vor und ist darauf spezialisiert, Cloud-zentrische Hilfestellung zu leisten. AI Shell ist für Windows, macOS und Linux verfügbar. \nDas war das KI-Update von heise online vom 25. November 2024.

    "content": "Linux beugt sich US-Sanktionen\n(Bild: Foto 4440/Shutterstock.com)\nDer Linux-Kernel hat russische Entwickler verbannt. Tatsächlich reicht der Schritt jedoch viel weiter. Inzwischen sind auch Huawei-Entwickler betroffen.\nVergangene Woche war der Linux-Systemkern Teil weltweiter Aufmerksamkeit, als dessen Chefentwickler Linus Torvalds den Rauswurf von 12 russischen Mitarbeitern ankündigte (Telepolis berichtete).\nWie sich herausgestellt hat, richtete sich der Schritt dabei keineswegs nur gegen Russland, sondern es wurden umfangreiche extraterritoriale Sanktionen des US-Finanzministeriums implementiert. Die jetzt auch andere getroffen haben.\nDer Ausschluss wurde über einen Patch in der Kernel-Version 6.12-rc4 vollzogen, der die entsprechenden Entwickler aus der \"Maintainers\"-Datei strich, in der alle Betreuer des Kernels aufgeführt werden.\nDie meisten der ursprünglich aus der Maintainer-Liste entfernten Programmierer arbeiteten an Treibern für Hardware von Unternehmen wie Acer, Cirrus und insbesondere Baikal, einem Unternehmen, das versuchte, in Russland entwickelte Arm-CPUs zu entwickeln und 2023 Konkurs anmeldete.\nEiner der betroffenen russischen Entwickler, Serge Semin, der anscheinend für das sanktionierte russische Technologieunternehmen Baikal arbeitete, veröffentlichte einen ausführlichen Abschiedsbrief an die Kernel-Liste, in dem er sich als \"Freiwilliger und Hobbyist\" beschrieb.\n Vordergründig steht die Entscheidung in direktem Zusammenhang mit dem Ukraine-Krieg, wie Torvalds selbst angab: \"Ich bin Finne. Dachten Sie, ich würde die russische Aggression unterstützen?\", erklärte Torvalds in einer ersten Reaktion auf die anschließende hitzige Debatte.\nTorwalds erklärte, sich nicht auf rechtliche Diskussionen einlassen zu wollen. \"Ich bin kein Anwalt, daher werde ich nicht auf die Details eingehen, die mir – und anderen Betreuern – von Anwälten mitgeteilt wurden\", sagte er.\nKernel-Entwickler James Bottomley gab in einer Mailingliste am 24. Oktober jedoch bekannt, dass Torvalds Begründung nicht den Kern der Angelegenheit trifft, indem er den Wortlaut der neuen \"Compliance-Anforderungen\" veröffentlichte:\nWenn Ihr Unternehmen auf der Sanktionsliste des US-Amts zur Kontrolle von Auslandsvermögen (Ofac) steht, einem Ofac-Sanktionsprogramm unterliegt oder sich im Besitz bzw. unter der Kontrolle eines gelisteten Unternehmens befindet, unterliegt unsere Zusammenarbeit mit Ihnen Einschränkungen und Sie können nicht in die MAINTAINERS-Datei aufgenommen werden.\nNoch am selben Tag wurden Forderungen laut, auch andere Kernelentwickler als Maintainer zu entfernen, wie aus der Mailingliste hervorgeht.\nDiese sind offenbar mit dem chinesischen Technologieunternehmen Huawei assoziiert, welches ebenfalls US-Sanktionen unterliegt. Kernelentwickler Quake Wang schrieb zur Begründung:\nEinige Einträge wurden aufgrund verschiedener Compliance-Anforderungen entfernt. Sie können in Zukunft nicht wiederkommen, da Huawei von den meisten freiheitlichen Ländern der Welt sanktioniert wird.\nKonkret geht es um 40 Entwickler, deren eMail-Adressen auf @huawei.com enden. Den Namen zu Folge handelt es sich vermutlich nicht nur um Chinesen. Ähnlich wie bei den russischen Entwicklern, dürfte die Auswahl auf Basis der Mail-Adressenendung erfolgt sein.\nLaut dem Listeneintrag arbeiten sie an verschiedenen Treibern für HiSilicon-Produkte, wozu beispielsweise Huaweis Kirin-Smartphone-Prozessoren zählen. Die meisten Huawei-Mobilgeräte setzen auf Android, das auf dem Linux-Kernel basiert. Wie andere Hersteller auch, ist das Unternehmen auf gute Treiberunterstützung angewiesen.\nBislang blieb es jedoch nur bei einer Forderung eines einzelnen Entwicklers, die betroffenen Maintainer scheinen weiterhin Teil des Projekts zu sein.\nDie Entwicklung wirft jedoch ein Schlaglicht auf die Frage nach der Unabhängigkeit freier Software, da die Ofac-Sanktionen prinzipiell unilaterale US-Maßnahmen sind und keinen Beschlüssen internationaler Institutionen entsprechen.\nLaut dem Fachportal ArsTechnica hat die in den USA ansässige Linux-Foundation bislang weiterhin nicht auf Anfragen zu den Vorgängen reagiert.\nRedaktionelle Anmerkung: Anders als in einer früheren Version des Textes behauptet, ist der Ausschluss der Huawei-Entwickler keine offizielle Entscheidung des Kernel-Entwicklerteams, sondern – bislang – nur eine Forderung eines einzelnen Entwicklers auf Basis der neuen Compliance-Richtlinien.\nHintergründe und Aktuelles zum Krieg Russlands in der Ukraine. \nHintergründige Gespräche über Politik, Medien und Wirtschaft. Hier hören Sie, was woanders fehlt.\n\n \nDurch Ihre Unterstützung werden Sie Teil einer Community, die unabhängigen und freien Qualitätsjournalismus schätzt und fördert. Bei uns finden Sie ein breites Spektrum an einzigartigen Themen und unabhängigen Stimmen.\n",

    "content": "\n               \n\nThe Linux Foundation Technical\nAdvisory Board (TAB) has decided to \"restrict Kent Overstreet's\nparticipation in the kernel development process during the Linux 6.13\nkernel development cycle\" based on a recommendation from the Code of Conduct\ncommittee.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to \"decline all pull\nrequests from Kent Overstreet\" during the development cycle.\nOverstreet is the creator and maintainer of the bcachefs filesystem.\n\n\n\nThis\naction stems from a message\nOverstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another\nkernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the\nincident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from\nOverstreet in that thread.

I'm mentioning this because of some private accusations I've received about using the Code of Conduct to exert power.\n- I'm fine with robust technical discussions and don't mind strong language directed at me. My cultural background is much closer to a direct and a potentially strong sounding wording than what would be considered much more politically correct by others. Personal attacks are neither productive nor they should be acceptable though. Any discussion stops there for me.\n- Sometimes there's no single right solution, and the most clever one isn't always the best way forward. Differences of opinion between reviewers/maintainers and patch submitters are expected.  Therefore different POV between reviewers/maintainers and patch submitters is normal and we should be able to sort those during a factual discussion. Our process  puts more burden on submitter to defend their approach. That might sounds unfair but this is a generally recognized process by the community. On the other hand maintainers should be always fair, respectful and open to arguments.\n- My response to Kent's public call out about feedback process is here https://lore.kernel.org/all/Zz7yqeI0RatH4ao5@tiehlicka/T/#u. I have tried to reference main entry points to discussions and I am open to hear specific feedback where my acting as a maintainer/reviewer could have been better or where it was unacceptable as Kent has concluded. \n- I was in private discussions with Kent prior publishing his Patreon post. I have tried to clarify my thinking process in discussions that he has pointed out in his blog post. I felt like this could help to narrow down the disconnect. I also had some disagreement in the description of those discussions and asked him to put direct references to those discussions so that curious readers could follow them without an additional burden of digging those up from archives.\n- The Code of Conduct committee contacted me last week for my opinion. I am not going to partially quote from that discussion but TL;DR summary would be that I do not insist on public apology nor I am a great proponent of enforced actions against individuals. I would much rather appreciate a private moderation while the discussion is tense and evolving in an unproductive way than punishment after the fact.\n- I do not want to judge CoC cmte decision in this case, though, because I was not part of private discussions. It is really hard to make an opinion without having the full context IMHO.\n\n\nMichal Hocko\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 8:16 UTC (Tue)\n                               by koverstreet (subscriber, #4296)\n                              [Link] (1 responses)\n      \n\nSorry I didn't end up doing the rewrite to incorporate your feedback - I ended up putting up what I had because at the last minute, when it seemed like things might go somewhere productive with the CoC, they didn't, so I felt I had to go with what I had, I'd pretty much lost energy to do more at that point.\n\n\nHoping we can get something done on PF_MEMALLOC_NORECLAIM for the Rust folks at some point - let me buy you a beer at LSF?\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 8:39 UTC (Tue)\n                               by mstsxfx (subscriber, #41804)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nTBH I am not even sure what this means.

You did talk about productivity a few times. In the blog post and probably also here in the comments. \n\n\nThis seems like a valid concern to me since we're yet to see how the CoC ages. It will probably age well but at the same time, leaving the allowance that it leads to reduced productivity might be a good idea until it is proven and it is evident that it does not. At the same time, since the otherwise is not proveably true, it doesn't seem fair to blame the CoC.\n\n\nThat aside, ideas on how to avoid reduced productivity in kernel development might be great. Ideas on how to improve productivity regardless of the CoC would be great. \n\n\nPS: Anarchy is not known to increase productivity.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 23, 2024 2:24 UTC (Sat)\n                               by JMB (guest, #74439)\n                              [Link] (19 responses)\n      \n\nI would really like to have explanation why excluding Russian kernel hackers and deleting\nthem from the maintainers file - without any personal communication - was not officially\ndealt with by CoC - from my point of view this would be obligatory!\nThis was much more severe - especially if it is true that some of them were not include\nin any list (which was reported by some news).\n\n\nGiving the impression that Russians may deserve that treatment just by warfare of their\ngouvenment is also not justifyable in an international environment - except they could change\nthose things or had been involved personally.

If the speakers had 2-3 hours to give.a tutorial on the Rust language; of its syntax and semantics, then as the climax of the talk, perhaps they could have shown off this super-clever construction.   But they ran out of time, because they only had 30 minutes, and they pushed the audience into the deep end of the pool without any preparation --- is it any wonder that a lot of questions were asked and the discussion became tense?   \n\n\nSo no, I don't think there was any Code of Conduct violation at the Rust session.    It is not a CoC violation to have technical discussions; even tense technical discussions.   It is fine to attack ideas; where it crosses a line is when people are attacked.\n\n\nThe technical points which Kent has raised, for example in his Patreon post, are really beside the point.   Regardless of the technical arguments he might have been trying to make, it was the personal attack which went beyond the pale vis-a-vis the Code of Conduct.   And while Kent might have been frustrated by the technical discussion, it didn't justify the public personal attack, and the way to repair the harm from a public attack is a public apology.  \n\n\nFinally, note that there have been other Code of Conduct violations over the past six years, and the Code of Conduct committee has investigated and stepped in to address them.   The only reason why this situation has been exceptional is because it is the first time that an enforcement action has been needed; most of the time, coaching and education from the Code of Conduct committee is sufficient.

It is an attack on an idea, not a person.    And by the way, Kent has done this a lot, himself, but this is not why he was called out.   He was called out because of his attack on a persom, not on how he argued his ideas.\n\n\nIt's also not true that such behavior will gain \"unanimous public support\".   Even on Kent's Patreon page, some of his supporters/funders called him out as going too far.   I am hope that perhaps if he were to meditate on how he has started to lose the room even among what should be his strongest supporters, maybe he might figure out that his behavior is ultimately self-defeating.\n\n\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 18:33 UTC (Sun)\n                               by rweikusat2 (subscriber, #117920)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\nI totally agree with your point: That's how it should be.

Why? IIt's nothing like being a doctor or lawyer or  general or diplomat or air traffic controller where situations can deteriorate in seconds and if you aren't doing your best work on zero notice, lives will be lost. It's not even like being an on-call sysadmin/SRE/etc. for a production server whose filesystem is misbehaving. The code in front of you isn't going to change until you run \"git pull\" and it's entirely at your discretion when to push, too. (Security vulnerabilities are an exception, but the post only talks about them in the context of designs that are known at the time of writing to lead to DoSes, not about a buffer overflow or speculation side channel being discovered and a race to patch it before it's exploited.) It may be a technically difficult and therefore mentally taxing job, but it should be no more stressful than being a sculptor or a carpenter or a poet.\n\n\nI think Kent's examples actually argue that stress makes the job worse: if people hadn't been so acrimonious about the folio reviews, they might have kept conversing to the point of finding that they shared the same long-term vision without needing a third-party mediator to figure it out. In fact the email at issue here is another counterexample: there was nothing about the code itself nor the technical disagreement that required being acrimonious (as evidenced by Kent's levelheaded explanation of the issue in the blog post). There is nothing inherent about Kent nor his interlocutor that meant that conversations must get acrimonious. It was the increasing heat in the thread that made Kent, in his telling, lose his cool and send a message that is objectively beyond the pale (and, in my opinion, still merits an uncomplicated apology). So the answer is that the thread shouldn't have started to get hot in the first place, and people should have stepped in at the first sign of rancor.\n\n\nAnd I do question the idea that people work best by yelling at each other over their code and then being friendly once it's over. In my experience there are some people who genuinely like intense arguments, and some who find them uncomfortable. There are people in this latter group who have nonetheless learned to perform the intense argument because they want to make some progress with people in the former group. But that does not at all mean they like doing so or that this process does not burn them out over time. If it really does work for a specific pair of people - they can yell at each other as much as they feel necessary over direct email without copying a list, over a call, or whatever, and then it's opt-in.\n\n\nFrom the stories in the blog post it sounds like heated disagreement is often used not as a tool in itself but a way to push people to expand on technical detail when it isn't forthcoming - to push back against the spreadsheet of decisions without rationale, to cause people to realize that an uninvolved mediator was needed, etc. If this is indeed what's going on, then Linus and the TAB should step in here - maintainers should not be able to block patches without an explanation understandable to at least one of the patch submitter, Linus, or someone on the TAB (which is a _technical_ advisory board, despite its role in CoC enforcement). People who have long-term plans in mind should be encouraged to publicize them. And it seems odd to me to support bypassing a maintainer and landing the patch in Linus's or some other tree directly, while also letting the maintainer continue to hold that role. Either the maintainer had a justified objection, and bypassing will just cause the maintainer to pick up code they'll want to revert (as happened here), or the person should not actually be trusted with the ability to block patches.\n\n\nI do agree with Kent's comments elsewhere in this comment section that this is an overall culture problem and kernel leadership could do a better job of setting the right tone from the beginning.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 23, 2024 7:24 UTC (Sat)\n                               by koverstreet (subscriber, #4296)\n                              [Link] (13 responses)\n      \n\nThe fight over whether XFS would have metadata checksumming split the team.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 23, 2024 22:25 UTC (Sat)\n                               by Heretic_Blacksheep (subscriber, #169992)\n                              [Link] (12 responses)\n      \n\nPeople can disagree without being abusive with each other.  Just because the other side becomes abusive doesn't mean you must as well.  People can lose an argument gracefully.  There's no loss of face to not having one's ideas accepted or implemented - even if those ideas are rejected for what might appear to be silly reasons to you.  Your apologies read as rationalizations rather than genuine apologies.  You're doubling down on your behavior rather than altering it.

If you don't play by the rules, at least for a while, you'll have a hard time convincing anybody that they need be changed.\n\n\nThis comes atop of that. I cannot see it as anything other than a political move. CoCs are usually worded so subjectively that they cannot be used for anything else anyway.\n\n\nI know it's frustrating to have excellent ideas and to see ways of improving things for everybody but with gatekeepers that prevent you from doing so for reasons they can't even articulate.\n\n\nBut at some point, everybody's human and that aspect has to be dealt with. No fights will be won if the group sees you as a disruptor, if the maintainers see you as demanding special casing and if people at large feel offended on behalf of others because of insinuations... I find it a shame that, having your wits, you've not yet understood that human dynamics, however stupid they might look, are a fact of life that you need to purposely navigate. Ignoring them won't serve you, nor your objectives, well.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 10:59 UTC (Sun)\n                               by RX14 (subscriber, #123970)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 20:04 UTC (Sun)\n                               by rra (subscriber, #99804)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\nAnd this is exactly the problem: you are at present unable to see how to have the fight without being abusive. No one is arguing against having the fight, only about how the fight is conducted.\n\n\nI'm just some random person on the Internet who has been in a lot of technical fights (in Debian, not in kernel development, so the context is admittedly different). You don't know me and you have no reason to take my advice. But my natural tendency is the same: I want to have a blunt discussion at the same level that the other person is discussing things, and if a point is particularly important to me or if something the other person says seems particularly outrageous, I want to drive home my point with force. I invent all sorts of justifications and reasons in my mind for why this time I need to put all of my emotion in the response, because some things DESERVE that emotion, damn it.\n\n\nIt doesn't help. It just doesn't. As much as I try to convince myself that this time for sure it will serve a purpose, it doesn't, not really.\n\n\nThe emotion is a crutch. The abuse is a crutch. It is your subconscious telling you that your argument is not working. The natural human reaction is to just apply more force, but applying more force causes damage and risks breaking all the components of the system, including you.\n\n\nRoughly speaking, there are four reasons why my arguments aren't working in a discussion and I become tempted to apply more force. My argument may be bad: insufficiently precise, insufficiently detailed, insufficiently supported. The topic may be a matter of subjective judgment or future prediction and the other person fully understands my argument and simply disagrees. The other person may be simply wrong and completely unwilling to see it. Or I may be simply wrong and completely unwilling to see it.\n\n\nIn every case, adding the abuse and emotion doesn't help and usually makes it worse. When you apply more force in the argument, not only do you inspire MORE resistance, not less, in the other person, you also harden your own position. You make it less likely that you will be capable of realizing when you're wrong because now you're emotionally invested and you would also have to admit your emotion was unjustified. If the argument is bad, no amount of additional force applied to it will make the argument better. And if the debate is over subjective judgment, you will not convince other people to substitute your judgment for theirs by being abusive, nor should you be able to.\n\n\nPounding on the keys harder doesn't make the bug go away. You have to actually find the bug and fix it, and pounding on the keys harder doesn't help and usually hurts. It's incredibly difficult to let the emotion go and instead try to calmly understand which of those cases applies and how to move forward, but that's what works. Sometimes I've gotten away with throwing a big enough tantrum that someone else stepped in and did the work for me, but that's not the person I want to be, and based on your writing I don't think that's the person you want to be either.\n\n\nI will grant that there are some exceptions for social problems where what's required is, essentially, a revolution or a threatened revolution and you need emotion to get people out into the streets and threaten violence, but I don't think that's the situation in kernel development and based on your blog post I don't think you think it is either.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 23:13 UTC (Sun)\n                               by raven667 (subscriber, #5198)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nThis is well said.  I've found out something similar after making this mistake several times and have learned to recognize when I feel that righteous anger \"how could they be so incompetent and stupid to not see X, Y, Z\" that I'm the one who needs to sit down and re-evaluate before going off because most times I've gone down the other road and chose escalation I have later found out that _I_ misunderstood something fundamental and made an ass of myself requiring an apology.

An offense has a victim.  The victim may very well have had it coming, but that has nothing to do with the apology.  A genuine apology makes no excuses, makes no mention whatsoever of the victim's share of culpability.  And it's good that it does not, because the circumstances that triggered the offense likely endure after the apology.  An apology does nothing to diminish the force of inoffensive arguments made in the context of the offense.  Quite the contrary, it removes a red herring.\n\n\nApologies are not easy.  It takes courage to apologize.  Apologizing shows courage.\n\n\nAn apology is disarming.  It lets the victim and the offender come to their senses.  It reduces strife and brings peace of mind to the apologizer.\n\n\nThere is no shame in apologizing, provided the apology is genuine.  A genuine apology, made publicly, generates admiration for the apologizer, for honesty, sincerity, and good judgement.\n\n\nIt's not too late to apologize, Kent.  You work hard and you argue hard.  You deserve to enjoy the benefits of being a person who apologizes. You owe it to yourself to apologize.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 17:47 UTC (Tue)\n                               by rgmoore (✭ supporter ✭, #75)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \nI agree with everything you say about the value of an apology. The only problem is that a real apology has to come from a genuine acknowledgment of having made a mistake. Someone who feels like they've done something wrong will want to apologize because they feel bad about what they've done and hope to make things better by admitting fault. The main reason so many apologies are bad is because they're insincere; the person making the apology refuses to admit fault and is only apologizing because they hope to placate the person they're apologizing to. Of course it fails because it's missing the main thing the person receiving the apology wants: an admission of wrongdoing.\n\n\n      \n          \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 27, 2024 10:20 UTC (Wed)\n                               by anselm (subscriber, #2796)\n                              [Link] (1 responses)\n      \n\nPlus, many “apologies” tend to be not “I'm sorry for what I did” but rather various versions of “I'm sorry you didn't like what I did” or “I'm sorry that I got caught doing what I did”.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 27, 2024 13:27 UTC (Wed)\n                               by Rudd-O (guest, #61155)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 25, 2024 13:48 UTC (Mon)\n                               by nim-nim (subscriber, #34454)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nBut most those professions rely on stored data, usually in a filesystem, and data corruption can cause those deteriorating situations sometimes years later when some corruption condition is met.

It can be a difficult thing to identify, particularly in the context of arcane technical debates and engineering discussions - making a convincing argument that someone you're dealing with is genuinely trolling can take a lot of work, and it's common for there to be disagreement about whether it *is* trolling or not, even after putting in that effort. But being difficult to prove conclusively doesn't stop it from being harassment - as much a form of harassment as intemperate language.\n\n\nI don't know if Kent would necessarily agree with this characterisation, but my reading is that he feels he was being trolled, and by someone in a position with enough authority to nack his patches (adding significantly to the impact of the trolling). Regardless of whether his responses were within the bounds of acceptable behaviour, trolling should be treated the same as any other claim of harassment, and it seems like a large part of the problem here is that Kent feels that the trolling he's experienced is being downplayed or ignored, while his intemperate language is being emphasised and ultimately punished.\n\n\n\"Don't be nasty to people\" is an easy thing to put in a code of conduct, and it's relatively easy to identify breaches and enforce consequences for those breaches.\n\n\n\"Don't troll\" is also pretty easy to put in a code of conduct - in fact it's already one of the examples of unacceptable behaviour in the kernel code of conduct:\n\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n  -  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n  -  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n  -  Public or private harassment\n  -  Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n  -  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n\nWhether reporting incidents to the Code of Conduct Committee would achieve anything I don't know.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 0:15 UTC (Sun)\n                               by koverstreet (subscriber, #4296)\n                              [Link] (6 responses)\n      \n\nAnd, I think asking the committee for intervention even more would just turn things into a circular firing squad.

I've certainly had my disagreements with Michal in the past, but *I* never felt the need to resort to personal attacks, and we eventually worked out a compromise (in fact, it was over __GFP_NOFAIL) \n\n\nWith respect to the mm/bcacefs thread, it certainly smeed to me that both sides seemed to be talking past each other, and I could see how both sides might feel that the other was ignoring their clearly, obviously, valid points.    Sometimes the answer to that is to try to hash things out over a video conference; or perhaps in person at an event like LSF/MM.   Or perhaps by trying your best to restate the other party's argument in as charitable way possible, and stating where you agree, and then trying to identify the precise place where you disagree.

The allocation could block\n * indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for\n * failure is pointless.\n * It _must_ be blockable and used together with __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM.\n * It should _never_ be used in non-sleepable contexts.\n * New users should be evaluated carefully (and the flag should be\n * used only when there is no reasonable failure policy) but it is\n * definitely preferable to use the flag rather than opencode endless\n * loop around allocator.\n * Allocating pages from the buddy with __GFP_NOFAIL and order \u003e 1 is\n * not supported. Please consider using kvmalloc() instead.\n\n\nwhile some callsites might have a error path one would have to review all existing users and add error handling where it is missing.\n\n\nSo now there are not really many options how to deal with GFP_NOFAIL with the _current_ semantic.\n1) drop __GFP_NOFAIL and get back to the situation that existing callers will revert to their endless loop around the allocator or simply rely on GFP_KERNEL effectively never fails semantic for non-costly (order \u003c 4) allocations.\n2) change the existing semantic and make it almost never fail - with a good definition of \"almost\"\n3) keep the strict never fail semantic that is currently documented.\n\n\nEach of the model has its cons and pros. 1 and 2 would require reviewing all existing users and that is not really trivial task. Option 3 needs to be really careful about unsupportable allocation requests (e.g. non sleeping requests would require essentially a busy loop around allocator without any upper bound, or higher order request could simply put the machine down through OOM killer storm because of the memory fragmentation). \n\n\nThe crux of the disagreement was in how to deal with impossible. Failing a (by definition) non-failing allocation can result in security issues (silent memory corruptions as this is not guaranteed to OOPS). Killing the allocation process might leave locks behind with similar effect but the fact could  be easier to observe in the kernel log (in a sense a guaranteed OOPs). Or keep retrying indefinitely and make the system unusable.\n\n\nWhat makes this decision making really hard is wide variety of allocator users. I am not really happy about the existing gfp flags semantics we have because it is really hard to understand unless you take the deep tour into the implementation. This results in misunderstanding and wrong use of the allocator. I have seen that countless times and I am definitely not blaming authors of the incorrect code. But seeing all this I am really concerned about adding more confusion like GFP_NOFAIL that can actually fail.\n\n\nI still believe that this kind of discussion is not completely insane.\n\n\nMichal Hocko\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 8:50 UTC (Tue)\n                               by mchehab (subscriber, #41156)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nIt sounds to me that maybe it is time to deprecate GFP_NOFAIL and replace it by other flag(s) that may have  a better defined semantics.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 6:34 UTC (Sun)\n                               by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nA very simple guide: just don't insult people.

Not escalate as in \"escalate the argument,\" but escalate as in \"appeal to a higher forum.\" That might be Linus, the TAB, or somebody else, I don't pretend to be an expert on Linux politics and procedure. The point is, there has to be somebody who is The Decider when discussion on LKML proves fruitless. That person is probably different depending on the scope of the disagreement (e.g. if two developers disagree about something that only affects subsystem XYZ, then the XYZ maintainer is probably The Decider for that particular disagreement, but code that touches multiple subsystems might need a Decider who is higher up the chain).\n\n\nI also want to stress that escalation is a process, not an event. You don't just shoot off an angry email to the next person up the chain as soon as somebody disagrees with you. If I were going to escalate a technical issue, in my professional life, I would start by writing up a short document explaining my view and their view, where we seem to agree, where we seem to differ, and what aspects we each seem to consider more important. I would then politely ask the other person to review that document and either agree with it or recommend changes, and I would (probably) allow them to freely edit the sections which represent their views. During this process, it is entirely possible that the disagreement would be resolved, and no actual escalation would need to take place. Since I work at a big tech company, my next step would be to show the document to my manager and ask them to figure out what to do with it, but I imagine the process in a community-run system like LKML will differ. Presumably, you circulate the document publicly for a while, then when it's in good shape, you show it to whoever The Decider happens to be and ask them to make a decision.\n\n\nThere are a few failure modes to watch out for:\n\n\n* If the other person gives a non-answer, such as just stating that my document is \"wrong\" or a \"waste of time\" without further information (or if they ghost me altogether), I would note their objection (and/or non-participation) in the document, ask them if they want to elaborate on it, and then proceed with the escalation anyway.\n* If the other person is The Decider and there is no higher authority... look, sooner or later, somebody has to lose one of these arguments. If you've already escalated all the way to the top and Linus/the TAB/whoever still thinks you're wrong, it's time to fold and either live with the decision or discontinue the affected work. If you feel really strongly, you could fork the kernel or carry an out-of-tree patch.\n* If the other person resorts to insults or other aggressive behavior, don't respond in kind. Ignore them or report them, as you see fit, and continue to discuss the substantive issue without regard for the insults.\n\n\nMy big tech company has an HR department, so these failure modes are generally less of an issue for me (they don't do this \"CoC\" stuff in professional tech, they just tell you to cut it out or you're fired). They are included mostly for completeness.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 24, 2024 10:49 UTC (Sun)\n                               by gmgod (subscriber, #143864)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 23, 2024 11:33 UTC (Sat)\n                               by leandro (guest, #1460)\n                              [Link] (3 responses)\n      \n\nOur civilisation is dying, it would be delusional to think the free software culture would survive it, save a miracle.

An inauthentic apology is absolutely a disservice to the person on the receiving end. I was coming at this from the perspective of a recipient. Healing comes from mutual understanding, not from retribution against your interlocutor via public humiliation. It just so happens that a forced apology is an easy way to give the outward appearance of mutual understanding without actually achieving it, and to those not emotionally invested in the situation, the mien of understanding is just as good as the real thing.\n\n\nApologies should come from the heart, and to say so does not diminish the harm caused by callous behavior nor justify insulting others.\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 8:29 UTC (Tue)\n                               by ssmith32 (subscriber, #72404)\n                              [Link] (19 responses)\n      \n\nHowever, it may help the person who did the insulting if they can be nudged to summon the willpower to put their pride aside in order for everyone to get back to insulting each other's specific ideas, instead of insulting the organ with which they create their ideas.\n\n\nIn short, this all seems to be taking place with actions and processes that assume everyone is operating at the emotional maturity level of a cloistered adolescent.\n\n\nIf a grown person can't stop from calling someone they work with an idiot in the middle of a debate about error handling, they lack the impulse control I would expect of an adult. \n\n\nConversely, if you're deeply hurt by someone you work with calling you an idiot, and consider yourself a \"victim\", I also would consider you emotionally immature. And you probably shouldn't take mass transit... or drive.. or ride a bike. All of which could result in people who are clueless calling you an idiot (e.g. I've been told to \"get the f** off the road\" and had cars swerve at me for being in a left turn lane on a bike... in areas where it would not only be illegal, but unsafe to pedestrians for me to be otherwise). So I ride on, leaving them to stew in traffic and ignorance.\n\n\nIf you sideline the person due to their poor impulse control and move on, that's fine. But you shouldn't be deeply hurt or regard yourself as a \"victim\".\n\n\nI do wonder if all these people who talk how rough and tumble the world of kernel development is, and needs to be, has ever sat down with an MMA fighter, let alone boxed their friends. One of the calmest dudes I knew was an MMA instructor - who had no trouble apologizing and never called anyone an idiot in anger. But nor did he get particularly offended by insults. He certainly had no desire to fight someone over juvenile name-calling, whether physically or otherwise. Unless he was getting paid to ;)\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 26, 2024 9:10 UTC (Tue)\n                               by Wol (subscriber, #4433)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nApologies for mentioning it again, but there is also the little problem of cultural clash. I could never get involved in a - fact based - discussion of race on Groklaw, because what was acceptable English for me was unacceptable for GL's American, but what was acceptable to them was totally unacceptable for me. What do you do? An apology from me for offending them is meaningless, but they're not going to apologise for excluding me from the conversation.\n\n\nOr I had a conversation with a co-worker (many moons ago). I got very stressed and agitated, and their manager complained to my manager about my \"threatening behaviour\". When I mentioned this to my co-worker she was shocked - she hadn't felt at all threatened (nor should she - it was obvious my stress-symptoms weren't aimed in her direction at all).\n\n\nThe only time an apology is going to work is when the apology-giver understands WHY an apology is necessary. I've learnt that - I use apologies to build trust. But if I'm going to \"I'm sorry you're offended over nothing\", I'm going to be extremely pissed off if I'm strong-armed into it. But if I realise the recipient is a shrinking violet - well it plays into my hands.\n\n\nCheers,\nWol\n\n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 27, 2024 0:52 UTC (Wed)\n                               by interalia (subscriber, #26615)\n                              [Link] (7 responses)\n      \n\nI feel you're reading too much into the word \"victim\", I look at it as being casually factual. If someone steals from me, I'm a victim of theft; if someone punches me, I'm a victim of assault. This isn't some deep assertion of victimhood on my part, but something I think you'd agree is trivially true. If someone yells an insult at me then I'm a victim of verbal abuse, in the literal sense of the sentence \"Person A verbally abused person B\". \n\n\nIt's just factual that misconduct of the above kinds has a perpetrator and a victim (and sometimes bystanders/witnesses), and I was the victim. If the misconduct was a personal insult that doesn't mean I am saying I was deeply hurt or traumatised by it, but I'm also not going to deny it. Misconduct happens with widely varying severity and trauma but at low trauma levels there isn't suddenly a lack of a victim, and I don't feel people should decline to use the word.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 27, 2024 13:17 UTC (Wed)\n                               by nye (guest, #51576)\n                              [Link] (6 responses)\n      \n\nI disagree with this really quite strongly.\n\n\nPushing somebody to breaking point so you can get the satisfaction of watching them lose their cool does not in any sensible definition make you a victim.

People hate being excluded.  It is actually a serious punishment; this is hard-coded into our DNA from our days of surviving in small groups in a hostile prehistoric environment.  It's why banishment has been a serious punishment for thousands of years across many different cultures.\n\n\nI think all of this is just performative BS.

I disagree.  There's a lot more cachet to having your code in the mainline kernel rather than a fork, and I think the action will make people think twice before embarking on public personal attacks.\n\n\n\n\n      \n          \n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 28, 2024 1:06 UTC (Thu)\n                               by pizza (subscriber, #46)\n                              [Link] (2 responses)\n      \n\nAre you seriously saying that being \"Excluded from working on the mainline by the linux foundation\" matters one iota when (1) your salary isn't being paid by said linux foundation, and (2) your actual employer is overwhelmingly likely to be shipping their own non-mainline fork?\n\n\nSeriously.\n\n\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 28, 2024 1:58 UTC (Thu)\n                               by mjg59 (subscriber, #23239)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 28, 2024 14:09 UTC (Thu)\n                               by dskoll (subscriber, #1630)\n                              [Link] \n      \nAre you seriously saying that being \"Excluded from working on the mainline by the linux foundation\" matters one iota when (1) your salary isn't being paid by said linux foundation, and (2) your actual employer is overwhelmingly likely to be shipping their own non-mainline fork?\nYes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  It might not matter financially in the short-term, but it does impact your career (public meltdowns are never good when you are job-seeking) and it matters personally.  Additionally, any employer shipping its own kernel would be much happier if the employee was not excluded from working on the mainline; this greatly simplifies maintenance of any fork.\n\n\nIf it really \"didn't matter one iota\", then this thread would have two comments on it instead of dozens/hundreds.\n\n\n      \n          \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 28, 2024 3:06 UTC (Thu)\n                               by intelfx (subscriber, #130118)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\nI wish it would.

FUD. It all starts with the rumor that supposedly engineers at Sun wanted a licence that is incompatible with GPL, well... people just took that as the base truth and it's done forever, when in fact... a source of that claim is a person who was supposed to be close to the process, but the guy who was her boss at the time says the exact opposite, the engineers wanted something BSD like and so the CDDL is a result of a corporate process, while the supposed GPL incompatibility was never a goal.\n\n\nIt was never tried in court, same as the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL and this \"it combines in memory so it is a derivative work\" stuff. My impulse whenever this comes up would be to fork Linux, publish it under a different name, with all this nerds-be-playing-lawyers-or-otherwise-gatekeep-because-NIH stuff gone. When I see how they treated Kent, that impulse is higher than ever. And AFAIK I would still be within my rights to do that, without creating any limitations on anyone's other's rights.\n\n\nThis nerd says that in OpenZFS case, CDDL is effectively practically compatible with GPL, because in spirit they truly are and that's the only thing that matters in the end, NIH or not.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 28, 2024 11:23 UTC (Thu)\n                               by snajpa (subscriber, #73467)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n     \n    \n Posted Nov 29, 2024 14:01 UTC (Fri)\n                               by paulj (subscriber, #341)\n                              [Link] (1 responses)\n      \n\nFormer Sun engineer here. I was not senior enough to be one of the engineers in the licence discussions for what became OpenSolaris, but the senior engineer in my group was. And he who told me that Sun management had wanted the GPL, but a number of very prominent Solaris engineers said \"hell no\". A similar account has been related by, IIRC, one or both of Simon Phipps and Danese Cooper (I forgot which). That account further describes that a group of said prominent senior engineers had threatened to quit Sun if management proceeded with the GPL.\n\n\nSo, this is something that has been described by multiple different people here on LWN - at least 1 of whom was in those meetings.\n\n\nThe one bit that is misdescribed there is that Sun wanted a licence \"incompatible with the GPL\". That part is not - TTBOMK - correct. At least, that was not a deliberate initial goal TTBOMK. For Sun management wanted the GPL itself, AIUI. However, various senior Sun engineers had a strong dislike of the GPL - most of them came from the BSD world. They did not want the GPL at all. They actually wanted Solaris to be placed under the BSD licence! (Is how my senior colleague told it to me anyway). A permissive licence was never going to fly for management. \n\n\nSo the constraints were (here I mix in /my summarisements/ with the facts I know of  above):\n\n\n- Management wanted to go open-source, as did engineering.\n- Management were not prepared to totally give away Solaris (i.e. no BSD licence), they wanted the strongest possible licence, i.e. copyleft\n-- Schwarz had written favourably about the GPL\n-- I believe management's initial idea was to use the GPL\n- Engineering hated the GPL and absolutely refused to go with that (I don't think there's a rational reason for this, just cultural factors from BSD leanings)\n- So... management decided to come up with some new licence\n-- Possibly legal also liked the idea of being able to write a new licence, and weren't fans of the GPL\n--- Though, some in Sun legal did help with input to the GPLv3 drafting process\n- We got the CDDL\n\n\nI don't know if anyone spotted the compatibility issues. There was extensive consultation about the CDDL within Sun prior to the decision. We were all - within the Solaris engineering group - given the opportunity to review it and give comments internally. I remember looking at it,  I don't remember thinking about compatibility or seeing the issue, unfortunately. Surely someone had thought about it, one way or another though.\n\n\nI think - with hindsight, applying my own speculative analysis - the decision to go with the CDDL, and in particular to *not* use the CDDL, is all about senior Sun engineers wanting to rescue their baby, Solaris. They could see the Sun setting, and that it could well go down. They wanted to extract their beloved software, Solaris, which they had spent years and years on, from the setting Sun before it was too late. To be able to take Solaris and keep working on it, and start new businesses around it, after Sun was gone. And I think a key thing for them to achieve that rescue was they either wanted unfettered access to the code (i.e. BSD) OR failing that they wanted to ensure it would be distinct from Linux.\n\n\nThat's just my subjective analysis. Cause it's the only thing that can make some sense of what happened. Going with a GPL-incompatible licence made no sense for Sun Microsystems, Inc. as a business. All it achieved was bad press and bad blood - despite Sun management being favourable towards the GPL. Sun released nearly all of Java under the GPL in '07. So clearly there wasn't an issue with upper-level management with the GPL. Yet Solaris went with the CDDL. It made no sense at all, except in the context that a bunch of high-profile Sun engineers just hated the GPL.\n\n\n     \n    \n    \n Posted Nov 29, 2024 14:12 UTC (Fri)\n                               by paulj (subscriber, #341)\n                              [Link] \n      \n\n\u003e Sun wanted a licence that is incompatible with GPL\n\n\nAt least, if you read \"Sun management\" for Sun. That said, based on what I wrote you /could/ argue there /may/ have been some subset of Sun (likely in Solaris engineering) who wanted that. However, I have _no_ direct evidence for that - I have not read any account of this. All I know is that a group of leading Solaris engineers vehemently opposed GPLing Solaris - I have read that account from either Phipps or Cooped (an account reported on on LWN) and I heard the exact same thing well before they had put that online straight from the mouth of someone who was there.\n\n\n     \n    \n\n            \n            Copyright © 2024, Eklektix, Inc.\n            \n            Comments and public postings are copyrighted by their creators.\n            Linux  is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds\n            \n            \n",

    "content": "Linux Daily Topics\n\n2024-11-29\n\n        記事の内容\n         2分\n      \nオープンソース開発者は自身のキャリア形成にあたってどんなリソースや機会を活用しているのか ―2024年6月から7月にかけてLinux Foundation ResearchとIntelが約300名の開発者を対象に行った調査「オープンソースソフトウェア開発者レポート 2024年版」が10月から公開されている。レポートには、オープンソース開発者がキャリアアップのために習得すべきと思っているスキル、参加しているイベント/コミュニティ、キャリア形成における優先事項など、2024年現在のオープンソース開発者のリアルな声が統計としてあらわされている。\nUnlocking Developer Potential: Exploring the Resources That Drive Career Growth -The Linux Foundation\nOpen Source Software Developer Report -The Linux Foundation\n\n本レポートはLinux Foundationに加入するメンバー企業/組織（1600社超）を中心に332名の調査対象者から集められた。対象者（回答者）は「開発者、またはソフトウェア開発チームの管理者のいずれかで、ソフトウェア開発に関わるIT職に就いている」「⁠フルタイムまたはパートタイムで雇用されている（自営/学生含む⁠）⁠、または失業中でIT職を探している」という基準を満たしており、また回答者が所属組織を代表して質問に対して正確に回答するのに十分な専門経験をもっていることも事前に確認されている。\n日常的にオープンソースに接する機会が多い開発者を対象にしている調査だけに、全体の96％がオープンソースソフトウェアを日常的に利用、その内訳は「オープンソースを利用し、かつ貢献もしている」と回答したのが49％、「⁠利用はするが貢献はしていない」は47％、「⁠まったくオープンソースに関わっていない」は4％となっている。また、回答者の88％が「オープンソースによって組織のイノベーションが加速する」ことに（強く、またはある程度）同意しており、オープンソースという多様な開発者から構成されるコミュニティドリブンなアプローチが開発者から広く支持されていることがうかがえる。\n本レポートで興味深い結果のひとつが、開発者がスキルアップや業界知識の獲得の手段として「オープンソースイベントへの参加」を重視している点だ。回答者のほとんどが自身の既存のスキルを向上させ、新規のスキルを習得し、業界の最新知識を取り入れ、さらに他の専門家とつながることをキャリア形成における重要な手段として位置づけているが、そのためのアクティビティとして「オープンソースイベントへの参加」を重要とした回答者が72％に上っており、一方で「業界団体やベンダが主催する展示会」は46％にとどまっている。また、オープンソースイベントへの参加者を重要視する開発者は増加傾向にあり、過去3年間でこれらのイベントの重要性が「大幅に増加した」「⁠やや増加した」と回答したのは52％、対象的にベンダ主催のイベントに対しては48％が「⁠（⁠重要性に）変化なし」と回答している。\n開発者がオープンソースイベントに参加して得られる価値として挙げているのは「モチベーション」「⁠インスピレーション」「⁠スキルの伝達」「⁠ベストプラクティス」「⁠コミュニティ開発」「⁠楽しみ」「⁠ネットワーキング」など多岐に渡っており、オープンソースへのより深い関与を促進する手段として効果的であることがわかる。とくに「インスピレーションとモチベーションを見つけること」は63％、「⁠ネットワーキングの機会」は53％が高い価値または非常に高い価値があると評価しており、オープンソースイベントで得られる新しい知識と人脈を今後のキャリア形成につなげようとする傾向があらわれている。なお、回答者の間でもっとも人気の高いイベントは「KubeCon/CloudNativeCon」（⁠40％）で、つづいて「Open Source Summits」（⁠27％⁠）⁠、「⁠PyCon」（⁠15％）であった。\nレポートではオープンソースイベント参加者の声として「自分の中でインスピレーションの火花が散るのを感じた。セッションのあと、勇気を出してパネリストのひとりに近づき、会話が始まり、いつの間にか連絡先や将来のコラボレーションのアイデアを交換していた」「⁠KubeCon Americasに参加して、オープンソースこそが唯一の方法であると心の底から確信した」「⁠自分の学習と成長を自分のものにし、プロジェクトの所有権をもち、革命を起こし、組織内の問題を解決する自信を得た」といったポジティブなコメントが紹介されている。\n一方で本調査では時間やコスト、地理的条件が障壁となってこうしたイベントに参加できない開発者も少なくないという課題も浮き彫りになっており、とくに地理的条件が障害となってオープンソースイベントに参加できないと回答したのは48％に上る。レポートではこれらの課題の解決に向けてアクセシビリティの向上の必要性を強調している。\n本レポートの執筆陣のひとりであるIntelのオープンエコシステム担当バイスプレジデント兼ジェネラルマネージャ Arun Guptaは、レポートの序文で以下のように述べている。\nオープンソースの背後にいる人々に会うのに最適な場所はオープンソース開発者イベントだ。私は過去数十年間に何百ものそのようなイベントに参加してきた。これらのイベントを通じて、世界中の何千人もの熱心なユーザーや貢献者とつながることができた。\n（～中略～）廊下での偶然のアイデア交換は、人々が直面している現実世界の課題、まだ文書化されていない革新的なソリューション、コミュニティ内で出現している新しいトレンドについて学ぶためにも重要だ。これらのカジュアルな会話は、多くの場合、新しいコラボレーション、新鮮な視点、オープンソース開発のニュアンスに関するより深い洞察につながる。最も有意義なつながりや画期的なアイデアのいくつかは、これらの計画されていない自然な瞬間に生まれるものだ。\nキャリア形成の場として、そして開発者ネットワーキングによるイノベーション誕生の場として、オープンソースイベントの重要性は今後もますます高まることが定量化されたかたちで裏付けられたレポートといえそうだ。\n同じ記事グループをもっと見る\nおすすめ記事\n記事・ニュース一覧\nCopyright © 2007-2024 All Rights Reserved by Gijutsu-Hyoron Co., Ltd.ページ内容の全部あるいは一部を無断で利用することを禁止します⁠。個別にライセンスが設定されている記事等はそのライセンスに従います。\n",

Canonical, the force behind Ubuntu, is returning as a gold sponsor at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024. \nThis premier event, hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, brings together the brightest minds in open source and cloud-native technologies. From November 13-15, 2024, we’ll be in Salt Lake City, Utah—don’t miss the chance to be part of this transformative gathering of industry leaders and visionaries!\nYou can book a meeting with our team here.\nCanonical recently celebrated 20 years as publishers of Ubuntu, the world’s most popular Linux operating system. Canonical’s portfolio covers critical systems, from the smallest devices to the largest clouds, from the kernel to containers, from databases to AI. With customers that include top tech brands, emerging startups, governments and home users, Canonical delivers trusted open source for everyone. \nCanonical containers are designed for modern software deployment. Our container portfolio ranges from an ecosystem of base OCI images, ultra-optimized chiseled container images to our long-term supported Docker images . \nAs developers build applications, they can count on Ubuntu for a seamless containerization experience—from development to production. With timely updates, robust security patches, and long-term support, Ubuntu ensures a consistent and predictable life cycle, backed by a reliable support commitment.\nThat’s not all: as part of the container design and build service announced on June 26, 2024, customers can engage Canonical to design a Docker image of an open source application, or a base image that includes all of the open source dependencies to host their proprietary app. They get hardened distroless container images with a minimal attack surface and 12+ years CVE maintenance. Canonical will support these custom-built images on all popular K8s platforms like RHEL, VMware kubernetes or public cloud. \nEngineered for your most critical workloads, Canonical’s open source data solutions deliver better ROI across clouds.  Our portfolio of images includes a comprehensive set of databases and big data containers that extend the same principles behind Ubuntu—reliability, security, simplicity and performance—to your data stack. \nWe provide containers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Spark, Kafka, Opensearch and Valkey. These images following the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format are optimized to run on any cloud, on-premise or air-gapped environment, and on any hardware. They run natively on Ubuntu, but are also compatible with any CNCF distribution of Kubernetes. Whether you need a minimal, stripped-down image with just the essential packages, or an image with all essential plugins—we have a ready-to-use, trusted container that can seamlessly integrate into your environment. \nOpen source enables organizations to iterate faster and accelerates project delivery, by taking away the burden of licensing and tool accessibility. However, GenAI comes with several challenges, such as the need for extensive compute resources and associated costs . In order to optimize the use of their compute resources, organizations need efficient and scalable AI infrastructure, from bare metal to Kubernetes to their MLOps platforms. \nOur Kubeflow distribution, Charmed Kubeflow, is designed to run on any infrastructure, enabling you to take your models to production in the environment that best suits your needs. \nYou can use Canonical’s modular MLOps platform to smoothly transition from experimentation to production, ensuring a quick return on investment. \nAt our booth K10, you will be able to see the full RAG pipeline setup that can be deployed on any cloud (public or private) using Canonical products Charmed Kubeflow and MLflow, Charmed Opensearch, MicroK8s and COS.\nCanonical and its close partners are moving AI forward. Come down to out booth to learn from our collaborations and find out how to:\nWe’ll be presenting Managed Kubeflow on Microsoft Azure to highlight our engagement with the Microsoft Azure community. It will include limited access to sign-up for the preview that canonical and microsoft will be running in the upcoming months. \nModel inference is not always straightforward – as organizations need to ensure the right tooling, the security of the model and the compatibility with the hardware underneath. Join our demo to see how Ampere and Canonical enable AI on the ARM platform, using MicroK8s. It will focus on a computer vision use case, which is suitable for a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing, retail and logistics.\nAs enterprises invest more into generative AI solutions, finding a toolchain that is easy to use, scalable and backed by enterprise support becomes vital for businesses looking to take full advantage of the latest innovations.\nIn this demo, we will delve into the NVIDIA NGC Catalog and NVIDIA AI Enterprise which offers a suite of AI tools and frameworks (including NVIDIA NIM microservices) that integrate into cloud native projects like Kubernetes and KServe while offering security and enterprise support.\nWe will demo how to take a state-of-the-art open Meta Llama 3.1 8b model, run inference using NVIDIA NIM, scale the model dynamically using the open-source KServe project, then use advanced PEFT techniques and deploy LoRA adapters trained by NVIDIA NeMo Customizer microservice to have multiple fine-tuned versions of the open model running on a single Kubernetes cluster.\nEverything shown during this demo can be repeated easily using resources that are readily available thanks to the large amount of community involvement around open model development and deployment.\nDuring Kubecon, together with thought leaders from NVIDIA, Bloomberg, Nutanix and RedHat, we will talk about model inference in the open source landscape. With a focus on KServe, the panel discussion will highlight the benefits of working with the community, the challenges that an open source solution provides and some of the most exciting enhancements that we think the future will bring.\nThe panel discussion will capture key considerations when integrating with a CNCF project, based on the experience of using NIMs with KServe. We will delve into the main differences between experimentation environments and how to scale such an environment. \nComputing power is still a concern for organizations, so running your GenAI projects on Google Cloud is a great option. Organizations can use a fully open source solution, to ensure portability. During our talk we will highlight main benefits of using open source for GenAI use cases, key considerations when scaling such projects and how Google Cloud is an enabler for enterprises.\nWe will be presenting a talk on Enterprise-Ready LLMs with Confidential RAG at the Intel booth. It will highlight how organizations who are using highly sensitive data can move beyond experimentation with their GenAI use cases. It includes key considerations, scalability concerns and a blueprint to use a fully open source solution. \nKubernetes has proven to be a vital tool for developing and running ML models. It significantly enhances experimentation and workflow management, ensures high availability and can accommodate the resource-intensive nature of AI workloads. \nAt Canonical, our aim is to streamline Kubernetes cluster management by removing unnecessary manual tasks. Be it the developer workstation, the data center, the cloud or an IoT device- deploying applications on Kubernetes should not be a different experience just because the infrastructure changes. That’s why Canonical Kubernetes provides zeroops for small clusters and intelligent automation for larger production environments that also want to benefit from the latest community innovations.\nCanonical Kubernetes is one component of our comprehensive infrastructure portfolio with which you can quickly build a private cloud to suit your needs and simplify operations with automation.\nWhether you’re building new products or AI models, it’s crucial to ensure that the pace of innovation is not hindered by security vulnerabilities. That’s why Canonical’s open source solutions come with reliable security maintenance, so you can consume the open source you need at speed, securely. \nMeet our team to learn more about Ubuntu Pro, our comprehensive subscription for open source software security.
